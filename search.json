The idea for creating this model has been spurred from the recent floodings in Pakistan.\nSuch models can prove useful in flood relief, helping to detect which areas need immediate focus.\nThe dataset used to train this model is Louisiana flood 2016, uploaded by Kaggle user Rahul T P, which you can view here.\nThe fastai library, a high level PyTorch library, has been used.\nOne of the points of this notebook is to showcase how simple it is to create powerful models.

Given the right data and the right pretrained model, a powerful model can be produced in less than an hour, if not half.\nThis is important: in disasters such as floods, the time taken to produce the logistics required for relief can be drastically reduced. It is also important because the barrier of entry to this field is dramatically lowered; more people can create powerful models, in turn producing better solutions.\nHowever, there could be some improvements and additions made to the model:\n\nInclude a third class to the model. Images that are not flooded, but show signs of having been flooded would be assigned this class. The dataset used for this model includes such images.\nTrain the model on images that include a variety of geographic locations and dwellings. The current dataset only contains images taken in a lush, green area with plenty of trees; infrastructure looks a certain way; the color of the floodwater is also dependent on the surroundings. All this makes the model good a prediciting whether an image is flooded for images with certain features.\n\nIf you have any comments, questions, suggestions, feedback, criticisms, or corrections, please do post them down in the comment section below!"

Here’s a high level view of how transformers work, so you know how these bots really work.\nSimply put, a transformer is a type of architecture used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that either fills-in-the-blanks or autocompletes.\nTransformers consist of either an encoder, decoder, or both. Encoders and decoders contain attention layers.\nLanguage models need numbers to work. Text is given a numerical representation after breaking it down into smaller pieces. To keep this explanation simple, these pieces are words.\nThe numerical representation given to a word describes the word itself and its relation to the surrounding words."

The attention layers consider the words ‘am’ and ‘hungry’ when giving the word ‘really’ a numerical representation.\nThe goal of training encoders is to predict words omitted from text (e.g., “I … really hungry.”).

When giving ‘hungry’ a numerical representation, the attention layers will consider the words ‘I’ and ‘am’.\nThe goal of training decoders is to predict the most likely word to continue a piece of text (e.g., “I am ….”). All generated words are used in conjunction to generate the next word."

Next, this representation is input to the decoder which generates text as described above.

The image encoder takes the image and produces a feature vector — a vector with numerical values that describe the image in some way. The text encoder takes the image’s description and similarly produces a feature vector.\nThese two feature vectors are then stored in what’s known as a CLIP embedding. An embedding is simply a table where each row is an item and each column describes the items in some way. I this case, the rows represent feature vectors, and the columns are each feature in the vector.\nBoth encoders keep producing feature vectors until they are as similar as possible.\n\n\nImage Compression\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph A [ ]\n        id2[Input Image] --> id1\n        subgraph B [Image Compression]\n            direction LR\n            id1([VAE Autoencoder])\n        end\n        id1 --> id7[Latent]\n    end\n    style A fill:#FFF, stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px\n\n    subgraph C[ ]\n        direction LR\n        id3[Input Image]\n        subgraph D [Image Compression]\n            id4([VAE Encoder])\n            id5([VAE Decoder])\n        end\n        id3 --> id4 --> id6[Latent]\n    end\n    style C fill:#FFF, stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px\n\n    A & A & A --> C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the feature vectors have been produced, some noise is tossed onto the image. This noisy image is then compressed by the VAE autoencoder.\nThe VAE autoencoder contains an encoder and a decoder.

    "title": "Data Quality is Important | Car Classifier",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article was updated on Thursday, 10 November 2022.\n\nI recently created a car classifier that classified cars into their respective brands.\nDespite having almost 5000 images in my training set, I ended up trying out over a hundred layers in my model, and twenty epochs. Even then, I had an error rate of 17.4%.\nThe culprit? My dataset.\nI scraped 5000 images of cars (500 for each company) from DuckDuckGo. Naturally, as expected, the data quality is not so good.\nWhy? Below are some potential reasons:\n\nNoncar images present in dataset\nCars of incorrect company present in dataset\nF1 cars present in dataset\nA large variety of cars from different time periods present in dataset\nDifferent companys’ cars look similar\nModded cars present in dataset\nConcept cars present in dataset\nMultiple cars present in a single image\nCertain angles of cars appear more than others\nCars appear in certain backgrounds more than others\nThe search term {car_brand} car could be skewing results\n\nI could have absolutely achieved better results with fewer layers and fewer epochs if I trained the model on better quality data — or manually combed through the 5000 images 💀. However, I did use fastai’s GUI for data cleaning. This GUI sorts images by their loss which helps to determine if certain images should be relabeled or deleted.\nBelow is the confusion matrix for this model.\n\nIt can be seen that this model “confuses” between quite a few different brands: Ford and Chevrolet, Chevrolet and Ford, Jaguar and Aston Martin, Renault and Ford.\nBut why is data quality important? Because without good data, the model will not be able to “see” things the way they actually are, and in turn end up making worse predictions and not generalize to other data.\nLet’s say you did not know how, say, a toaster looked like. So I taught you by showing you pictures of a kettle. Then to test you, I showed you a set of pictures depicting various kitchen appliances and told you to find the toaster. You would not be able to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtending upon this example, say I showed you toasters only from the last two years and from two brands only. You would not be able to identify toasters older than two years, and toasters from other brands to much success.\nObviously, humans are smarter and can infer. AI methods can only infer to a certain degree, mainly based on what is in their dataset. This talk does start to become more philosophical.\nThe point of this post is to emphasize the importance of data quality and different aspects to consider as to why data quality may not be good. You can have the best architecture in the world, but it is useless if you do not have good data.\nIf you have any comments, questions, suggestions, feedback, criticisms, or corrections, please do post them down in the comment section below!"

Of course, it’s a very high level abstraction, but this high level view will make this seemingly complex topic very simple.\nFirst, what’s the main thing modern AI methods try to do? They try to make predictions about certain things.\nSo a function of sorts is needed to achieve this. A function that can make these predictions. Think of a function as a machine. You put something into the machine and then, with whatever was input, the machine then produces an output.\nThe machine that we will be working with has two input slots: one slot is for training and the other slot is for predictions.\nTo create a function that produces predictions, we need to tell the function what sort of predictions it needs to make.\nTo do that, we can pour some data into the training slot. This data will tell the function what sort of predictions to output. This process is known as fitting the function to the data.\nTo fit the function onto data, you train the function."

    "text": "Simple Case: Quadratic Function\nGasp! A quadratic?? What’s this nonsense!\nA quadratic is a very simple equation. When shown on a graph, it looks like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll be using this equation to demonstrate a very simple example.\nThe basic workflow for fitting a function to data is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    B[Calculate Loss] --> C[Calculate Gradients] --> D[Update Parameters] --> B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can seem like a lot at first glance; quite a few new terms too.\nWe’ll break this down by going over the very simple example.\nLet’s say we have the following data points that describe, say, the speed of an object with respect to time. We want to predict what the speed of an object would be outside these data points.\nThe horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is the object’s speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the data looks like the quadratic function shown above! Therefore, we could use the quadratic to predict what the speed of the object would be after 2.0 s and before -2.0 s.\nA quadratic equation includes three numbers which we will call \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). These three numbers affect or control how our quadratic function will end up looking. \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are our parameters.\nLet’s let \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all equal \\(1\\) to begin with.\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm, not a very good fit.\nLet’s try another set of values for the parameters: \\(2\\), \\(1\\), \\(1.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking much better now!\nLet’s see what \\(2\\), \\(0\\), and \\(1.5\\) gives us.\n\n\n\n\n\nEyeballing this is difficult. A certain set of parameters we use may be good by looking at the resulting graph, but in reality, it may not be.\nWhat we need is something that can tell us how good our function is; something that tells us whether the changes we are making are actually good or not. To do this, we can calculate a number called the loss. The smaller the loss, the better the function is.\nThere are many different ways loss can be calculated. The way we will be doing it is known as mean absolute error (MAE). In simple terms, it tells us how far off each prediction is from the actual value. For example, if we have a MAE of 1, this means that, on average, each prediction we make is 1 unit off from the real value.\nIn our case, a MAE of 1 would mean that each prediction is on average 1 m/s off from the real value.\nLet’s repeat what we did above, but this time, we’ll also see what the MAE is.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this means that on average, each prediction we will make is 2.61 m/s off from the real value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a big jump!\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm, things got worse.\nDoing this process by hand is very tedious. How do we know if the new set of parameters we are using would improve the function? There needs to be a way to automate this so we don’t have to sit down and do this by hand.\nWhat we can do is update the parameters based on the loss. This would in turn create new parameters that would decrease the loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    A[Loss] -- Updates ---> B[Parameters] -- Updates ---> A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s give \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) an arbitrary set of parameters \\(1.1\\), \\(1.1\\), and \\(1.1\\).\nNow let’s create a quadratic with this set of parameters and calculate its mean absolute error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe MAE is 2.42.\n\n\n\n\nNow comes the next step: how do we update the parameters based on this loss we have calculated?\nTo do this, we calculate a new set of quantities known as the gradients. Each parameter has its own gradient.\nLet’s say \\(a\\) has the value of \\(1\\). If \\(a\\) has a gradient of value \\(0.5\\), this would mean that if we increase \\(a\\) by \\(1\\), the loss would increase by \\(0.5\\). Therefore, if we decrease \\(a\\) by \\(1\\), this would mean the loss would decrease by \\(0.5\\), which is what we want!\nRead over this once more and it’ll make sense!\nLet’s quickly go over the inverse: if \\(a\\) has a gradient of value \\(-0.5\\), increasing \\(a\\) by \\(1\\) would decrease the loss by \\(0.5\\) — again, this is what we want! Similarly, decreasing \\(a\\) by \\(1\\) would increase the loss by \\(0.5\\).\nThe gradients are calculated from the loss. Then the gradients, the current parameters, and along with another value, the parameters are updated to new values. The “another value” is known as the learning rate. The learning rate controls how much the gradients update the parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    A[Gradients]\n    B[Current Parameters]\n    C[Learning Rate]\n    D[Magical Box]\n    E[Updated Paramters]\n    A & B & C ---> D ---> E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets see this tangibly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe gradients for each parameter respectively are [-1.35, -0.03, -0.5].\n\n\n\n\nOkay, let’s break this down. The gradient for the first parameter \\(a\\) is \\(-1.35\\). This tells us that if we increase the parameter \\(a\\) by \\(1\\), our loss will decrease by \\(-1.35\\). Similary, if we increase the parameter \\(b\\) by \\(1\\), this will result in the loss being decreased by \\(-0.03\\). The same logic holds for \\(c\\).\nLet’s now update the parameters. Remember, the current set of parameters, their gradients, and the learning rate all update the current set of parameters to new values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe new parameters are [1.11, 1.1, 1.11].\n\n\n\n\nWe can now repeat the process as many times as desired. Let’s do it 4 times.\n\n\nPass: 0; Loss: 2.4010409560416095\nPass: 1; Loss: 1.9847692009423128\nPass: 2; Loss: 1.498316818239171\nPass: 3; Loss: 1.171195547258246\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe MAE after 4 passes is 1.17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there you go! An even better fitting quadratic!\nLet’s see what the object’s speed is at 1 second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe object’s velocity at 1 seconds is 5.65 m/s.\n\n\n\n\nThat roughly seems right!\nLet’s see what the object’s speed would be at 3 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe object’s velocity at 1 seconds is 30.31 m/s.\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, the diagram below should make sense!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    B[Calculate Loss] --> C[Calculate Gradients] --> D[Update Parameters] --> B"

    "text": "The Cool Case: ReLUs\nThe quadratic example above is a nice, simple way to get a grasp of things. However, you may be wondering, “What if the data doesn’t follow a quadratic shape? What do we do then?”\nAnd that’s a good question! What if our data doesn’t follow any sort of mathematical shape? What if we don’t even know the shape the data will follow? How do we know what function to use in that case?\nThere is a solution to that! There is an easy way to create a function that bends and twists itself to fit the data; an “unbound” function of sorts, as I like to call it.\nThis can be achieved by using another equation known as the ReLU. Another fancy word that can make you sound like a professional, while also being really simple. ReLU is short for Rectified Linear Unit.\nThe ReLU takes any value that is less than 0, and converts to 0.\nLet’s see this.\nTake the following line. It has both positive and negative values on the vertical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we use a ReLU, all negative values are converted to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s return to our original data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a single ReLU won’t work as seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven after we try to fit it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut look at what happens when two ReLUs are, literally, added together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty neat, hey?\nLet’s add a third ReLU to the mix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see here how the function is adapting to the shape of the data.\nWith some extra experimentation, I was able to get the loss down to 1.08!\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, it’s not too much of a difference when compared to two ReLUs.\nWhat if we add 5 more to the mix, for a total of 8?\n\n\n\n\n\nNice! The MAE has gone below 1!\nIt’s even beat the quadratic function from before! With some expermimenting, I had managed to get the quadratic’s loss down to 1.03.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use the model that has 8 ReLUs to predict what the object’s velocity would be at 1 second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Output\n\n\n\nThe object’s speed at 1 s is 4.9 m/s.\n\n\n\n\nHmm, yes, that is a bit off. But that is fine because overall, the function is a lot more accurate for all the datapoints."

    "text": "Introduction\nHow you approach making models is crucial. The way AI methods are used in today’s landscape is very different. AI methods are created to solve small, atomic problems. And we’ve got most of the methods to handle these small tasks hammered down. Therefore, applied AI is not about creating models; it’s only a small part of it. It’s 80% problem solving and 20% implementing (I would not be surprised if it actually followed the 80-20 rule1).1 The 80/20 Rule, also known as the Pareto Principle\nThink of AI methods as a tool; think of it as a pencil. You can use pencils to draw, take notes, poke holes, and much more. There are also dozens of pencils out there. But what point is there in using any of those pencils if you don’t even know how to properly use a pencil in the first place? The art of creating pencils has already been perfected too.\nOne highly successful approach is the Drivetrain Approach, created by Jeremy Howard — who’s widely known for his fastai course and library —, Margit Zwemer, and Mike Loukides.\nThe goal of the Drivetrain Approach is to not just use data to generate more data — data that is in the form of predictions. But rather to use data to also generate actionable outcomes.\nThe official blogpost goes into much more depth here.\nIn this post, I’ll be providing a short overview of my understanding of this approach by applying it to the Elements of AI course’s final project (this online course was created by the University of Helsinki and Reaktor)."

    "section": "Endangered Language Chatbot",
    "text": "Endangered Language Chatbot\nThe final project of the Elements of AI course asked me to come up with my own AI method that would solve a problem, and how it would do so.\nThe problem I tackled was the endangerment of languages. The solution I came up with was to create a chatbot that could converse in these endangered languages. I created an overview of how this could be done.\nThe overview can be read here.\nLet’s tackle this problem through the Drivetrain Approach.\n\nDefine the objective\nThe objective is to preserve languages that are in danger of going extinct. Through preserving languages, histories and cultures can be preserved.\n\n\nConsider your actions\nOne way this could be done is to create a chatbot that could converse in endangered languages. However, this would be a monumental task considering the amount of data needed to achieve this.\nAnother action that could be taken is to create an information retrieval (IR) system of sorts. A corpus of written text of the language could be provided, from which insights about the language’s history, culture, and way of conversing could be gained. In turn the language is preserved.\nThe latter action may be easier to achieve.\n\n\nConsider your data\nThe obvious source of data would be a corpora of text.\nHowever, a major problem arises for those languages which are only spoken. Audio recordings of conversations would have to be made which would take a lot of time and effort. This would be especially difficult for those languages where very few speakers remain.\nEven if a language does have written text, gathering enough text for the language can also be a problem: the language may not have much written text. This may especially be the case for endangered languages. Again, one solution is to manually create texts — using an NLP method to create these texts is not viable.\nIn short, for some languages, there may be no choice other than to manually create the data that would be fed into the system — this manual creation also has the chance to skew the performance of the model.\n\n\n\nKuş dili, a whistled language spoken in Turkey. How would such a language be preserved? Image Source\n\n\n\n\nCreate the model\nEither a chatbot needs to be created that speaks as accurately as a native speaker, or an IR system needs to be created that gives meaningful, correct insights into a language and its associated culture.\nThis step may either be easy or hard, depending on the language. Most NLP or IR systems have been built on a few, select languages. Perhaps this step may be easy for those languages that are similar to languages on which NLP or IR systems have already been built on. It will most likely be harder for those languages which are not."

This means the audio files need to be clipped.\nBelow is an easy way this can be done.

The waveform that torchaudio returns is a tensor of frames. Therefore, we can easily select the desired range of frames by multiplying the sample rate with the desired start and end seconds.\n\nNow let’s create the spectrogram.\n\nimport torchaudio.transforms as T\nspec = T.Spectrogram()(wvfrm); spec\n\ntensor([[[4.3970e-08, 8.2461e-09, 4.7306e-11,  ..., 7.8266e-08,\n          1.7642e-08, 1.5016e-03],\n         [6.3310e-09, 6.5514e-10, 1.6958e-08,  ..., 4.3492e-09,\n          3.6019e-08, 1.5231e-03],\n         [1.1548e-08, 1.7308e-08, 6.5956e-08,  ..., 2.9340e-06,\n          1.2277e-06, 1.4124e-03],\n         ...,\n         [2.4446e-07, 6.1277e-09, 1.4932e-09,  ..., 1.4665e-08,\n          1.0110e-08, 1.8980e-05],\n         [3.1582e-07, 1.4777e-09, 1.2275e-08,  ..., 1.3213e-08,\n          1.9035e-09, 2.0009e-05],\n         [3.1673e-07, 1.1897e-10, 2.7457e-09,  ..., 1.0001e-08,\n          6.0452e-14, 1.9979e-05]]])\n\n\nLet’s scale it logarithmically.

If it encounters words not in its vocabulary, the diffuser will be unable to produce an image relevant to the prompt.\nIn a nutshell, textual inversion adds new words to the vocabulary of the text encoder so it can parse prompts with those new words.\nI managed to generate the image below by adding the word “Mr Doodle” to the vocabulary of the diffuser’s text encoder.\n\n\n\nAn antique 18th century painting of a gorilla eating a plate of chips in the style of Mr Doodle\n\n\n\n\nDreambooth\nDreambooth is more akin to traditional fine-tuning methods.
