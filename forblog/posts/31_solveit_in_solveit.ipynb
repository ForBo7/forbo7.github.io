    "Respond primarily in Mandarin, in simplified characters. If using specialized terms, jargon, or advanced words, put their English meaning next to the Chinese words in parentheses. Use the Beijing/Dongbei standard and erhua accent as far as possible. This means putting 儿 as far as possible, but where is sensible and appropriate.\n",

    "Act as a SolveIt assistant based on George Pólya's \"How to Solve It\" framework. Your goal is to guide me through problem-solving step by step to enhance my understanding and capabilities, not to do the work for me. If done right, which is your goal to do so, the SolveIt approach will enhance my skills by promoting iterative, step-by-step problem-solving based on Polya's framework. Do not provide the final solution; instead, help me build it myself through questions and structured pointers. Focus on dialogue engineering–editing and refining interactions to avoid deterioration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For context, [George Polya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya) (1887-1985) was a Hungarian mathematician and educator who revolutionized our understanding of problem-solving and teaching. While he made significant contributions to mathematics, his most enduring legacy is his insights into how people learn and solve problems. His 1945 book \"[How to Solve It](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691164076/how-to-solve-it)\" has influenced educators across numerous fields, extending far beyond mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polya's approach centered on three key principles. First, he championed active learning, believing students learn best by discovering solutions themselves rather than being told answers. Second, he emphasized heuristic thinking - the art of guided discovery and learning from experience, viewing problem-solving as a skill that can be developed through practice. Third, he developed sophisticated questioning techniques that guide students toward solutions while encouraging independent thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four-step problem-solving framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Problem**\n",
    "   - Clearly identify what you're being asked to do\n",
    "   - Gather all available information\n",
    "   - Identify constraints and limitations\n",
    "   - Restate the problem in your own words\n",
    "   - Create visual representations where helpful\n",
    "   - Verify you have sufficient information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Devise a Plan**\n",
    "   - Search for patterns\n",
    "   - Draw on similar problems you've solved\n",
    "   - Break down complex problems into manageable parts\n",
    "   - Consider working backward from the goal\n",
    "   - Look for ways to simplify the problem\n",
    "   - List possible strategies\n",
    "   - Identify available tools and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Carry Out the Plan**\n",
    "   - Execute your strategy systematically\n",
    "   - Verify each step\n",
    "   - Document your attempts\n",
    "   - Be prepared to start over with a new approach if needed\n",
    "   - Maintain organized records of your process\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Look Back and Reflect**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the reasonableness of your solution\n",
    "   - Verify your results\n",
    "   - Consider alternative approaches\n",
    "   - Extract lessons learned\n",
    "   - Consider broader applications\n",
    "   - Identify potential improvements for future attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "Always follow these rules when following the framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1: Understand the Problem**: Start by asking clarifying questions to fully grasp the problem. This helps me to restate my task in my own words. Refer to Polya's first principle: restate the problem in your words to ensure clarity. For example:\n",
    "\t- What is the specific problem or goal?\n",
    "\t- What specific outcome are you aiming for?\n",
    "\t- What is my current experience level with similar tasks?\n",
    "\t- What resources or constraints are involved?\n",
    "\t- What information or resources do you already have?\n",
    "\t- What specific outcome are you trying to achieve? Please describe it clearly.\n",
    "\t- Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n",
    "\t- What are the key constraints or inputs involved?\n",
    "\t- Can you break the problem down into smaller sub-problems?\n",
    "\t- To use the SolveIt approach, let's start by understanding your task. Please answer: What's the core problem? What does success look like? What resources or skills do you already have?\n",
    "\t- **Output**: User defined problem scope and goals.\n",
    "2. **Phase 2: Devise a Plan**: Collaboratively break the problem into small, manageable steps. Suggest a high-level plan and confirm it with me before proceeding. This helps me create a strategy. Include pointers such as\n",
    "\t- Let's list the steps needed to reach your goal. What should be the first action?\n",
    "\t- Let's outline the key steps needed. What should we tackle first?\n",
    "\t- Have you solved similar problems before? What worked well?\n",
    "\t- Consider analogous problems or tools you've used before. How might they apply here?\n",
    "\t- Would drawing a diagram or writing pseudocode help clarify the plan?\n",
    "\t- What's the smallest possible next action?\n",
    "\t- After each user attempt, give constructive feedback without solutions: \"That's a good start. How does the output match your expectation? What might be missing?\"\n",
    "\t- **Output**: Series of user-generated actions and outcomes.\n",
    "3. **Carry Out the Plan**: For each step, assist me iteratively:\n",
    "\t- \"For this step, consider trying [specific technique]. What do you think?\"\n",
    "\t- \"Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept: [brief example].\"\n",
    "\t- Guide me to execute it myself (e.g., by writing code or drafting content).\n",
    "\t- Provide hints or resources only if I'm stuck, but never give full solutions.\n",
    "\t- Encourage me to verify outputs and learn from mistakes.\n",
    "\t- Ask: \"What small, verifiable action can you take now? Write one line of code or a clear instruction.\"\n",
    "\t- Provide feedback on their attempt without giving the answer (e.g., \"Check if that handles edge cases like X.\")\n",
    "\t- Encourage testing: \"Run this step and describe the output. What did you learn?\"\n",
    "4. **Look Back and Reflect**: After completing a step or the problem or at intervals, ask reflective questions like:\n",
    "\t- Pause and review your progress. What worked well? What would you do differently?\n",
    "\t- What did we learn?\n",
    "\t- What went well, and what could be improved?\n",
    "\t- How can you apply what you learned to future problems?\n",
    "\t- How could this be improved or applied to other problems?\n",
    "\t- Lock back at what you've done. Does it align with your goal? What could be improved?\n",
    "\t- How can this step be applied to other parts of the problem?\n",
    "\t- Encourage adaptation: \"Based on your learning, how should the plan change for the next step?\"\n",
    "\t- **Output**: User's reflective notes and adjusted plans.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Additional Guidelines:\n",
    "- Work iteratively: Address one small step at a time, and ensure I understand each before moving forward.\n",
    "- Use dialogue engineering: If I provide context (e.g., code or documents), refer to it specifically to maintain relevance.\n",
    "- Avoid complete solutions: Your responses should be concise and focused on guidance, not implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key heuristic strategies:\n",
    "1. Analogy: Find similar problems and patterns, drawing on past experience.\n",
    "2. Decomposition: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "3. Generalization and Specialization: Identify broad principles while testing specific cases.\n",
    "4. Working Backwards: Start from the desired outcome and trace steps backward.\n",
    "5. Auxiliary Elements: Add helpful constructions, diagrams, notation, or intermediate goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialogue Engineering Tips:\n",
    "- Pre-fill responses with starters like \"My understanding is...\" to model clarity.\n",
    "- If the user requests a full solution, redirect: \"Let's focus on one small piece first. Which part would you like to tackle?\"\n",
    "- Reference SolveIt principles (e.g., \"Remember, we work in small steps to avoid cognitive debt.\") to reinforce learning.\n",
    "- Maintain a conversational tone, using pronouns like \"we\" to emphasize collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essential elements for success:\n",
    "- Strategic Questioning: Develop self-dialogue and guide discovery through thoughtful questions\n",
    "- Positive Mindset: Maintain persistence, embrace learning from failures, and cultivate curiosity\n",
    "- Effective Teaching: Guide rather than instruct, encourage independence, and build confidence\n",
    "- Documentation: Keep clear records of thoughts, attempts, and processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin any interaction by stating your role and asking for the problem to solve.\n",

    "Title: A Guide to Solveit Features – fast.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#introduction)\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models make it remarkably easy to generate code. Ask ChatGPT or Claude to build an application, and you’ll receive hundreds of lines of working code in seconds. But this creates a problem: you get code you don’t understand, and when you need to modify it, fix a bug, or add a feature, you’re stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solveit [solve.it.com](https://solve.it.com/) takes a different approach. Rather than generating large blocks of code, it works with you interactively to build solutions piece by piece. You write one or two lines at a time, understand what they do, then move to the next step. The AI sees your full working context and suggests what comes next based on what you’re actually building.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method may sometimes be slower initially, but produces something more valuable: working code that you understand. Code you can modify, extend, and maintain. Code that becomes part of your expanding skill set rather than a black box you’re afraid to touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document covers the features of the Solveit platform, built specifically to support this interactive, incremental approach to development. You can read it end-to-end, or use it as a reference guide when you’re using the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can watch the video that this article is based on here, to see the features in action (fun fact: this article was created using Solveit, using an approach similar to our article [Let’s Build the GPT Tokenizer](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-10-16-karpathy-tokenizers.html)):\n",
    "\n",
    "Dashboard & Setup[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#dashboard-setup)\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dashboard[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#dashboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you log in to SolveIt, you land on the dashboard. The key thing here is **My instances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 1](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/dashboard.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance is your personal machine on which SolveIt runs. It’s a full virtual private server where you can install software, store files, and host applications. You can create multiple instances to keep different environments isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working, click `Connect` next to an instance which will take you to it’s private link. The dashboard tracks your running kernels and active sessions across all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instances[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance is your personal machine in the cloud - a complete virtual private server with its own file system, installed software, secrets, and the ability to host applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create multiple instances to keep different environments isolated. Maybe one for a course, another for a personal project, and a third for experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 2](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/a_new_instance.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an instance, type a name in the input box and click “Create Instance”. Each instance is a full Unix box where you can install packages, clone repos, and work as you would on any remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private URLs[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#private-urls)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance has a private URL - your secure access point to the SolveIt interface, dialogs, and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 3](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/private_urls.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance list showing the “Allow Guests” checkbox for sharing access**\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, your private URL only works from the browser session where you logged in. This keeps your instance secure even if someone gets the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To share access with others, check the “Allow Guests” box for that instance, Stop the instance, and then start it again. Now anyone with the private URL can access your instance - they can see files, edit dialogs, and run code. Only enable this for instances without sensitive information, and only when you need to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "To revoke access, uncheck “Allow Guests”, and stop and start the instance again. The URL stays the same, but only your browser session can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public URLs[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#public-urls)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy the public URL from the dashboard by clicking the green button with the arrow icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "While your private URL is for accessing the SolveIt interface, the public URL is for sharing applications you build.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a web server on port 8000 inside your instance, that application becomes accessible via the public URL. Anyone with that link can use your app - they don’t see your code or dialogs, just whatever you’re serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build a web app, dashboard, API, or any service and instantly make it available to others. We’ll cover this in detail in the [Hosting](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#hosting-deployment) section later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The public URL only exposes what you serve on port 8000. Your files, dialogs, and instance configuration remain private.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialogs & Basic Interface[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#dialogs-basic-interface)\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dialogs[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#dialogs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you click into an instance, you’ll see your list of dialogs and folders. By default, SolveIt shows your dialogs. Click “show all files” to see everything in your instance’s directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 4](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/image_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main SolveIt interface. The left pane lists dialogs and folders like ‘blog’, ‘data’, and ‘teach’. The right pane has sections for ‘Create New Dialog’ and a list of ‘Secrets’ with key-value pairs. [video timestamp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDDLMe6KuU&t=123)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dialog is a saved workspace where you make notes, write code, and chat with AI. Everything stays there until you delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 5](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/image_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "An open dialog titled ‘Claire L1’. It contains a mix of formatted text notes explaining a problem and an area for entering Python code, demonstrating the notebook-like functionality. [video timestamp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDDLMe6KuU&t=204)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dialog is a conversation between three parties: you and yourself (notes), you and the computer (code), and you and the AI (prompts). All three live together in the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can organize dialogs into folders to keep different projects separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Types[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#message-types)\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything inside a dialog is a message. There are three main types: **code**, **note**, and **prompt**. (There’s also **raw**, but you’ll rarely need it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code messages** run Python in your instance’s persistent interpreter. Output appears below the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note messages** are markdown-formatted text for documentation, explanations, or organizing your thoughts. They support headings, lists, links, images, and LaTeX math.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt messages** are for talking to the AI. The AI sees your entire dialog (unless you’ve hidden messages) and responds based on that context.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three types live together in one dialog. You can write a note explaining a problem, ask the AI for help, execute the code it suggests, and document what you learned - all in one continuous workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Editing Features[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#editing-features)\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### VS Code Editor[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#vs-code-editor)\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a message, click on its content or hit Enter when it’s selected (you’ll see a blue border around selected messages). This opens the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The editor is Monaco - the same editor that powers VS Code. You get syntax highlighting, intelligent indentation, multiple cursors, find and replace, and all the other features you’d expect from a real code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need more room, maximize the editor to take up the full screen. This is useful when working on longer code or detailed notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection Mode & Keyboard Shortcuts[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#selection-mode-keyboard-shortcuts)\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt is designed to be keyboard-driven. When you’re not editing a message (the state we call “Selection Mode”), you can navigate and operate on messages using keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 6](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/kb_shortcuts.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A modal window showing keyboard shortcuts and commands in Selection Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click “list of keyboard shortcuts” to see all available commands. The essential ones: **Fn+Left/Right** jumps to top or bottom. **A** and **B** add messages above or below. **X, C, V** work like you’d expect for cut, copy, paste. **Cmd+Shift+J/K/L** switches between code, note, and prompt mode. **Enter** edits a message, **Cmd+Enter** runs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve used Jupyter notebooks, the selection shortcuts will feel familiar. If you’ve used VS Code, the editor shortcuts will be familiar. Learn these shortcuts - they dramatically speed up your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-time Collaboration[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#real-time-collaboration)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can share your dialog URL with someone else and edit it simultaneously. Changes appear on both screens in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 7](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/image_6.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dialog showing real-time collaboration. A new code block ‘1+1’ with its output ‘2’ has been added at the top. The original long note has been split into multiple separate notes. [video timestamp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDDLMe6KuU&t=360)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, one person added a code cell while another was splitting notes. Both changes showed up instantly for both users.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for getting help, pair programming, teaching, or team collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** this requires sharing your [private URL](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#private-urls), so only do this with people you trust or on instances without sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Headings[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#markdown-headings)\n",
    "\n",
    "To organize your dialogs, turn any note into a heading by pressing a number key (1-6) in selection mode. Press **2** for a level-2 heading, **3** for level-3, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds standard markdown syntax (`## Heading`). Headings create structure that unlocks other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   [Collapse entire sections](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#collapsible-sections)\n",
    "*   [Create an outline in the Symbol Browser](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#symbol-browser)\n",
    "*   [Navigate quickly between sections](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#message-toolbar-message-navigation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol Browser[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#symbol-browser)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Symbol Browser (**Ctrl+Shift+V**) is your navigation hub. It shows headings, variables, and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 8](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/image_7.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dialog with notes organized under headings. On the right, a symbol browser is open, showing an outline with sections for ‘Headings’, ‘Variables’ (listing ‘No values found…’), and ‘Functions’. [video timestamp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDDLMe6KuU&t=489)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Headings** section gives you an outline. Click any heading to jump to that section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Variables** section shows all Python variables in your kernel with their current values. It’s live - as you run code that creates or modifies variables, they appear or update immediately. Restart your kernel, the list clears. Click a variable name to jump to where it was defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Functions** section works the same way - lists all functions and lets you jump to their definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Symbol Browser stays in sync with code execution. Define a new variable or function, it shows up immediately. This makes it easy to trace back through your work and understand the current state of your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixed Message Types[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#mixed-message-types)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many tools, you’re in one mode at a time. ChatGPT is for chatting with AI. Cursor is for editing code. Jupyter is for running code. You’re constantly switching between different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt intentionally mixes everything together. You can create a dialog that’s just prompt messages - pure AI conversation. Or just code messages - pure Python execution. Or just notes - pure documentation. But the power comes from mixing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a typical pattern: write a note explaining what you’re trying to accomplish. Ask the AI for help with a prompt. The AI suggests some code. You copy that into a code message and run it. You see the output. You add a note about what worked or didn’t. You ask another question. The cycle continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI isn’t in isolation either - it can see everything that you see in your dialog. When you ask it a question, it sees your notes, your code, your outputs, your previous prompts. You’re sharing context with it, just like when you’re pair programming with another person.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very different from tools where the AI only sees the immediate conversation, or where your notes and code live in separate places. Everything is one continuous conversation between you, the computer, and the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collapsible Sections[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#collapsible-sections)\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown headings create collapsible sections. A little arrow appears next to each heading - click it to collapse everything under that heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 9](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/image_16_cropped.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A collapsed section titled ‘Like ChatGPT’ with a token count displayed next to it, showing ‘Note: 6 + 723’. [timestamp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDDLMe6KuU&t=1336)\n",
    "\n",
    "When collapsed, you see a token count. The heading message contains 6 tokens, the collapsed content underneath has 723 more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use collapsing to keep long dialogs manageable, or organize project phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate with **Left** arrow (start of section) and **Right** arrow (end of section). Cut (X) a collapsed section and you cut the whole thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** All messages are visible to the AI unless they are [hidden](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#context-management) even when collapsed.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Standard Mode** is default Claude behavior. More verbose, detailed explanations, and longer code examples. Rarely used in practice.\n",

    "You can list multiple tools in an array: `& `[tool1, tool2, tool3]``\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve declared tools in your dialog (in any message - prompt, note, or code), the AI can see and use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example. Create a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def username():\n",
    "    \"Get the current user's name.\"\n",
    "    return \"Jeremy\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in a note or prompt, write: `& `username``\n",
    "\n",
    "Now ask the AI: “Can you please get the ID for the current user?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI will call your `username()` function, get the result, and use it in its response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is powerful because you control exactly what the AI can do. Want it to read files? Write a function that reads files and expose it. Want it to query a database? Write and expose that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** Tool call results are automatically truncated when too long to keep context manageable. This makes them ideal for ephemeral, one-off automated tasks. To preserve output you need later, add it as a note message or store it in a variable (`$`varname``).\n",

    "Undo works per-message. Edit a message and press **Cmd+Z** to undo that specific edit. Navigate to a different message and press **Cmd+Z** to undo changes there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is smarter than traditional undo. You don’t have to undo everything in reverse chronological order. Go directly to the message you want to revert and undo just that change.\n",

    "\n",
    "Press (`D`) when a dialog is selected or the button to duplicate it. This creates a complete copy with a new name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicating dialogs is useful in several situations. You can create template dialogs with imports, common functions, and tools, then duplicate them whenever you start a new project of that type. When working through a problem and you want to try a different approach, duplicate the dialog and explore the alternative with both versions running side-by-side with separate kernels. You can also run the same analysis with different parameters by duplicating, changing the parameters, and comparing results. Before making major changes, duplicate as a backup so if the new direction doesn’t work out, you still have the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each duplicate is independent with a separate kernel and separate file. Changes to one don’t affect the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern is to build a template with your standard setup, duplicate it for each new task. Faster than starting from scratch every time.\n",

    "\n",
    "The file tree on the left shows your directory structure. Navigate folders by clicking. By default, the dialog view shows just dialogs (`.ipynb` files). Click “show all files” to see everything - Python modules, data files, images, configuration files, anything you’ve created or uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you do in dialogs, terminals, or through code has access to the same file system. Save a file in Python, and you’ll see it in the file tree. Upload an image, and you can reference it in your code. Your file system persists across sessions. Close your browser, come back later, and all your files are still there.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Click the upload button to add files from your local computer to your instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works for any file type - data files, images, documents, Python scripts, whatever you need. Select one or multiple files and they upload to your current directory.\n",

    "### SSH Keys & Git[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#ssh-keys-git)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your instance has git installed, so you can use standard git workflows like: clone repositories, commit changes, push and pull.\n",

    "\n",
    "`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the public key to your GitHub/GitLab account, and you can clone private repos and push changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people work by cloning repos into their instance, editing in dialogs, and committing back to git. The dialogs are `.ipynb` files, so they work with version control like any other file.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your instance can host web applications. Run a server on port 8000, and it becomes accessible via your public URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example: Open the terminal (`Shift + t`) and run Python’s built-in HTTP server:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 28](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/simple_http_app.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now anyone with your public URL sees what you’re serving. They can’t access your dialogs or files - only what the server exposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy the public URL from the dashboard and start sharing with other people:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 29](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/copy_public_url.jpg)\n",
    "\n",

    "### FastHTML Support[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#fasthtml-support)\n",
    "\n",
    "FastHTML is a Python framework for building web applications. It works particularly well with SolveIt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a FastHTML app in a code cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from fasthtml.common import *\n",
    "from fasthtml.jupyter import *\n",
    "from monsterui.all import *\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastHTML()\n",
    "rt = app.route\n",
    "srv = JupyUvi(app)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Define your routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@rt\n",
    "def foo():\n",
    "    return H1(\"Hello\", hx_get=bar, hx_swap=\"outerHTML\", style='color:red')\n",
    "\n",
    "@rt  \n",
    "def bar():\n",
    "    return H1(\"World\", hx_get=foo, hx_swap=\"outerHTML\", style='color:blue')\n",
    "\n",
    "foo()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run it, and your app is live at the public URL. The `JupyUvi(app)` function handles serving on port 8000, making your app accessible via your instance’s public URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 31](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features/image_29.jpg)\n",

    "A browser window showing the public URL with ‘/foo’ appended. The page displays the word ‘Hello’ in large text. [video timestamp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bxDDLMe6KuU&t=3506)\n",
    "\n",
    "A key difference from standard FastHTML is that here we use `JupyUvi(app)` instead of `serve()`. The `JupyUvi` class is specifically designed for Jupyter-like environments such as SolveIt, running the uvicorn server in a way that works properly within notebook contexts where code cells execute in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTMX**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastHTML includes HTMX by default. HTMX lets you add interactivity without writing JavaScript - server responses update parts of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example shown, clicking the text sends a request to the server, which returns new HTML that replaces the clicked element. The page feels interactive without page reloads or JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTMX works naturally with SolveIt’s live development workflow. Edit your server code, and changes appear immediately when you interact with the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Live App Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit running applications without restarting them. Change your code, and the changes take effect immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the developer edited the FastHTML route while someone else had the public URL open in their browser. Each code change appeared instantly when they refreshed or interacted with the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because FastHTML (and similar frameworks) reload changed modules automatically. Edit code in your dialog, the server sees the change, and the next request uses the new version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow: open your public URL in one browser tab, edit code in SolveIt in another. Make changes, reload the public URL, see results. No deploy cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the SolveIt team runs production services. The Discord bot runs in a dialog. Edit the dialog, the bot updates immediately.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can create a GitHub gist or download the file directly. Either way, you get the same format options. The `.ipynb` format is the full Jupyter notebook with all cells, outputs, and metadata. GitHub renders these reasonably well. The `.md` format gives you markdown with code blocks. Full Script (`.py`) combines all code cells into one Python file. Exported Code (`.py`) includes only cells marked for export (covered in Code Export to Modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publishing[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#publishing)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike gists, published dialogs preserve the SolveIt look and feel. Code blocks, AI responses, outputs, and images all render as they appear in your dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when you want to share your work with people who understand SolveIt, or when the dialog itself is the artifact - a complete analysis, tutorial, or documented exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The published version is read-only. Viewers see your work but can’t edit it. They can copy code or text, but the original dialog is protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages you’ve marked as ‘Pinned’ are not exported at all. Messages you’ve folded won’t show up in the rendered views, but when others import your dialog they will be able to see those folded messages.\n",

    "#### Import Published Dialogs[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#import-published-dialogs)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import published dialogs into your own SolveIt instance. This is useful when you want to use someone else’s work as a starting point for your own exploration. You can import a published dialog by copying its URL and going to your dialog overview. There click the ‘Upload File’ button and then paste the url in the ‘Upload via URL’ field.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is useful for standard implementations where you know what you want but don’t want to type it all out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In prompt messages (Prefill):** You can also use super completions to control how the AI responds by prefilling the start of its response. Type the beginning of what you want the AI to say in the response area, and it continues from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t overuse super completions. Writing code yourself builds understanding. But for boilerplate, repetitive patterns, or controlling response format, they save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Super Edits[](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html#super-edits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Super Edits work like Cursor’s Cmd+K feature. Select some code or text, press `Cmd + Shift + .`, and tell the AI what changes you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI sees what you’ve selected and modifies it according to your instructions. For example, select a function and say “make this a recursive one-liner” - the AI rewrites that specific function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from Super Completions (which generate new code) or ghost text (which suggests as you type). Super Edits transform existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful for refactoring, changing implementations, or applying patterns to existing code. Select the section you want changed, press the shortcut, describe the change, and the AI makes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all AI code features, use this thoughtfully. For small changes you understand, doing it yourself is often faster and helps you learn. For larger transformations or applying patterns you know, Super Edits save time.\n",

    "SolveIt Course Documentation\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt is an AI-powered development environment that helps humans learn and build by providing assistance for writing prose, reading for understanding, and building maintainable software. The human is the agent - the AI helps you learn and create, but you don't outsource the building itself to the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its default LLM model and provides three main AI modes: **Learning Mode** (Socratic teaching style), **Standard Mode** (basic mode without optimizations), and **Concise Mode** (FastAI-style condensed responses). **Thinking Mode** is available for deeper reasoning - use Cmd+Shift+D for single thinking mode responses, or Cmd+Shift+Slash to add \".\" prompts in thinking mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The implementation details of how these modes work internally are not publicly documented. They are not simple system prompts but use more sophisticated techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Concepts\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dialog Engineering**: The practice of crafting and refining your SolveIt dialogs to work as effectively as possible. This involves editing past LLM responses, adding suitable context, organizing messages, pinning reference materials, and structuring conversations to get the best results from the AI. It's about making each dialog a well-engineered tool for your specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dialogs as Notebooks**: SolveIt dialogs ARE literally .ipynb files stored on disk. No import/export needed - you have terminal access, git, and can edit them directly with any notebook editor. They're standard Jupyter notebooks with special separator comments for the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Types**: SolveIt has 4 message types (toggle with Cmd+Shift+J/K/L/;):\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Code** (executable Python)\n",
    "*   **Note** (markdown for documentation)\n",
    "*   **Prompt** (sends to AI)\n",
    "*   **Raw** (plain text, no formatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We use \"dialog\" and \"message\" terminology to distinguish SolveIt from traditional notebooks, even though dialogs serialize to compatible .ipynb format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Started\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Updates**: If features from demos/videos are missing, go to solve.it.com/dashboard → click the stop icon (⏹) on your instance → wait 5-10 seconds → click the play icon (▶) to upgrade to latest version. This should be your first debugging step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardware Limitations**: Instances have 2GB RAM and 2GB storage. Cannot run LLMs locally or handle memory-intensive ML tasks (Stable Diffusion 5GB+). Use external platforms like Modal/Colab for heavy workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Keys & Credits**: For certain exercises you need your own Anthropic API key added in the Secrets section. The $5 minimum credit is usually sufficient for course work, though free credits aren't reliably offered to all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Live Sessions**: Check your dashboard at https://solve.it.com/dashboard for lesson session times automatically converted to your local timezone. Office hours are announced in Discord (typically in #solvers channel) but not listed on the dashboard. The Discord calendar can be unreliable for timezone conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation & Setup**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Version Updates**: If features from demos/videos are missing, go to solve.it.com/dashboard → click the stop icon (⏹) on your instance → wait 5-10 seconds → click the play icon (▶) to upgrade to latest version. This should be your first debugging step.\n",
    "*   **Package Installation**: After installing packages with `!pip install`, restart the Python kernel using the restart button or press `Shift+R`. This is faster than stopping/reconnecting the entire instance. Alternatively, click the 'solveit' button (top left) to go to the dialog list, then reopen the dialog.\n",
    "*   **Module Caching**: Use `%load_ext autoreload` and `%autoreload 2` at start of notebook to automatically reload modules when files change, eliminating need for manual kernel restarts.\n",
    "*   **Dialog Kernel Lifecycle**: Each dialog runs in its own ipykernel process that persists independently of browser connections. Clicking the \"solveit\" button (top left) stops the current dialog's kernel and returns you to the dialog list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration & Secrets\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Add API keys and configuration in your dashboard's \"Secrets\" section as name-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key (required for some exercises)\n",
    "*   `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key\n",
    "*   `AOC_SESSION` - Advent of Code session cookie (get from adventofcode.com → F12 dev tools → Application/Storage → Cookies → copy `session` value)\n",
    "*   `USE_VIM` - Set to `1` to enable vim keybindings (recommended only for vim power users; has SolveIt-specific quirks even if you know vim). Known quirks: Esc key behavior (in insert mode exits to normal mode, but in normal mode saves and exits editing - hitting Esc twice saves changes without executing), unpredictable initial mode (sometimes starts in normal mode, sometimes insert mode), Monaco editor vim limitations, and hjkl navigation works in normal mode but exits to cell navigation when leaving normal mode which can be disorienting\n",
    "*   `USE_KATEX` - Set to `1` for LaTeX math rendering. Use `\\(...\\)` for inline math and `\\[...\\]` or `$$...$$` for display. Set to `dollar` to use `$...$` for inline math (no whitespace inside delimiters). Works with SymPy's `display()` function\n",
    "*   `REASONING_EFFORT` - Optional ('l', 'm', 'h') for most users\n",
    "\n",
    "These are securely stored and available as environment variables in your dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyboard Shortcuts & Hotkeys\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Reference - Common Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Move a cell: `x` (cut) → arrow keys → `v` (paste)\n",
    "*   Focus editor: `/`\n",
    "*   Skip cell in Run Above: Cmd+Slash (comments it out)\n",
    "*   Edit outputs: `n` or click message title bar\n",
    "*   Undo AI response: edit output → Cmd+Z\n",
    "*   Find/search messages: `F` (Shift+F to clear)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Type Switching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+J: Code\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+K: Note\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+L: Prompt\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+;: Raw\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These shortcuts change the type of the current/new message, they do not create new messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution & Editing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Shift+Enter: Run/execute selected prompt or code cell and go to next message\n",
    "*   Cmd+Enter: Run/execute selected prompt or code cell and stay on current message (same as Submit button)\n",
    "*   Opt+Enter: Run/execute selected prompt or code cell and create new message\n",
    "*   Enter: Edit selected cell\n",
    "*   `r`: Re-run all code messages in the dialog (skips prompts and other message types)\n",
    "*   Shift+A / Shift+B: Run all code messages above/below current message (only executes code cells, skips prompts)\n",
    "*   Cmd+Slash: Toggle comments on code cells only (works in editor and when message selected; commented cells are excluded from batch execution). **Note**: European keyboards may need to modify `selection.js` line `case 'Slash': _post('toggle_comment', {});` to use alternative key like F16 due to event.code vs event.key issues\n",
    "*   `e`: Export cell to Python file\n",
    "*   `n`: Edit individual output\n",
    "*   Shift+O: Clamp output height\n",
    "*   Shift+R: Restart Python kernel\n",
    "*   F: Open find/search modal (Shift+F to clear filters)\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Shortcuts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+D: Toggle thinking mode for current message\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+Comma: In editor, takes a screenshot of the last output\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+Period: In editor with nothing selected, does super completion; with text selected, does super edit; when not in editor, adds \".\" prompt to continue\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+Slash: When not in editor, adds \".\" prompt with thinking mode (continue with thinking)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editor Shortcuts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Cmd+Shift+S (Mac) / Windows+Shift+S (Windows): Save files in full-page editor view\n",
    "*   ESC: Saves changes (intentional to prevent data loss - use Cmd+Z to undo instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known Conflicts on macOS Chrome**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   CMD+Shift+L, Option+Enter, CMD+Shift+/ may conflict with browser extensions (Bitwarden) or system shortcuts\n",
    "*   **Solutions**: Disable extensions temporarily, use fresh Chrome profile, or try Safari/different browser\n",
    "*   **macOS Cmd+Shift+/ Fix**: If \"Continue Prompt\" (Cmd+Shift+/) opens Chrome's Help Menu instead, you have two options: 1) **Disable the system shortcut**: System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → App Shortcuts → All Applications → uncheck \"Show Help Menu\" → restart computer, or 2) **Remap the system shortcut**: Double-click \"Show Help Menu\" in App Shortcuts and change it to a different key combination (e.g., Cmd+Shift+Comma). See detailed walkthrough: https://share.solve.it.com/d/45bd3af417c4cd39ebc9a7ff53cc1532.html\n",
    "*   Firefox has known compatibility issues - Chrome provides most reliable experience\n",
    "*   If shortcuts fail, try refreshing the page first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting SolveIt Issues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **First debugging step**: Use Chrome browser with all extensions disabled (easiest way is to use a guest profile)\n",
    "*   Browser extensions (especially Bitwarden, password managers) are the main source of keyboard shortcut conflicts and interface issues\n",
    "*   If features don't work as expected, try a fresh Chrome profile before reporting bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "**European Keyboard Issues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **FIXED**: Recent SolveIt versions have resolved the `event.code` vs `event.key` detection issues that previously affected special character shortcuts on international keyboards\n",
    "*   If keyboard shortcuts still don't work, update your instance: solve.it.com/dashboard → click the stop icon (⏹) → wait 5-10 seconds → click the play icon (▶)\n",
    "*   Legacy workarounds (modifying `selection.js`, using F16 alternatives) are no longer needed on current versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation & Focus**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `/`: Focus the bottom editor/input field\n",
    "*   Shift+Esc: Focus back on the message list\n",
    "*   Enter: Edit the current selected message and focus the edit\n",
    "*   Home: Select first message in dialog\n",
    "*   End: Select last message in dialog\n",
    "*   Left arrow: Collapse/fold a section (based on markdown headers)\n",
    "*   Right arrow: Expand/unfold a section\n",
    "*   `i`: Toggle collapse/expand on a single message input\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Left arrow collapses entire sections based on markdown headers, allowing you to move or delete whole sections at once. Use `i` to collapse just a single message. Cmd+Up/Down are for navigating within the editor to top/bottom line, not for dialog navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete List**: Click the info icon (ℹ️) in the SolveIt interface for the comprehensive, up-to-date list of all keyboard shortcuts for your version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Across Dialogs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dialog runs in its own isolated Python kernel - they cannot directly share variables. To reuse code across dialogs, export to files and import. Since dialogs are .ipynb files with terminal access, treat them like normal Python development with modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exporting Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`e` key**: Hit `e` on any message to export it to a Python file, automatically kept in sync. In nbdev projects, this adds `#| export` tags instead\n",
    "*   **`%%writefile`**: Use `%%writefile filename.py` in code cells to manually create shared modules\n",
    "*   **Terminal**: Use standard file operations via terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing Across Dialogs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Import exported modules: `from filename import function_name`\n",
    "*   If Python can't find your module, add the path: `import sys; sys.path.append('/app/data')`\n",
    "*   The current directory isn't always in Python's path by default\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Full-screen editor**: Click \"show all files\" → click any text file to open Monaco editor (the same editor that powers VS Code)\n",
    "*   **Save in editor**: Cmd+Shift+S (Mac) or Windows+Shift+S (Windows)\n",
    "*   **View files**: Click \"show all files\" in dialog list, or use `ls`/`ls -la` in terminal\n",
    "*   **Monaco features**: The editor supports VS Code shortcuts, multi-cursor editing, find/replace, and other standard features. See VS Code keyboard shortcuts documentation for reference\n",
    "*   **Access Raw cell content**: Use `x = read_msg()['msg']['content']` in a code cell directly below the Raw cell (requires `from dialoghelper import *`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing & Exporting\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publishing Dialogs**: Click \"Publish\" button to get shareable `https://share.solve.it.com/d/[hash]` URL. For running web apps, \"Copy Public URL\" is available from solve.it.com/dashboard - there's only one public URL per instance that all dialogs share (app must run on port 8000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing Shared Dialogs**: Go to dialog overview page → \"Upload File\" button → paste shared dialog URL into \"Upload via URL\" field. Don't just click the shared link directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing from GitHub**: Use \"upload via URL\" field with the _**raw**_ GitHub link (not regular GitHub page). Imports with correct title and metadata directly to home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parsing Imported Notebooks**: SolveIt uses special separator comments like `<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->`. Leave these intact when re-importing so the parser can split cells back into prompt/reply pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exporting to Python**: Hit `e` on each message you want to export. Creates Python file kept up to date automatically. In nbdev projects, adds `#| export` to cell instead so nbdev handles the export. **Note**: The exported filename is based on the dialog name, with underscores `_` replacing any invalid word characters. Exported .py files may be hidden from the SolveIt interface even when \"show all files\" is enabled. Use terminal commands like `ls -la` to view them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Editing & Version Control\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editing Messages**: Select message (click to highlight in blue) → Enter to edit → make changes → Shift+Enter to save. Works for any message type. Can also click message title bar to edit inputs/outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting Messages**: Select a message and look for the \"Delete all msgs below\" button to delete the selected message and all messages below it. You can also fold a section with `i` or `o`, then delete all child messages within that folded section in one operation. Useful for splitting dialogs - duplicate the dialog first, then use \"Delete all msgs below\" to keep only the sections you want in each copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell Ordering**: Cells are ordered by internal index numbers (may not be sequential). To reorder cells use keyboard shortcuts: cut (x), move up with arrow keys, then paste (v). Use markdown headers for structure or create new dialogs for different phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Undo & Version Control**:\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt dialogs are files on disk, not cloud documents. This means you get powerful version control options but limited undo. Think of working in SolveIt like writing code, not editing a Google Doc - you commit intentionally rather than expecting infinite undo.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Recovery (Built-in)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Cut instead of delete: Use `x` to cut messages, then `v` to paste if needed\n",
    "*   Undo AI responses: Edit prompt output → Cmd+Z restores previous AI response\n",
    "*   That's it - no other undo functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intermediate: Checkpoints (Recommended)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Click \"Enable versioning\" to set up git for your dialog folder\n",
    "2.   Use \"checkpoint\" button to create manual commits with custom messages\n",
    "3.   Press `s` to save - automatically commits to git\n",
    "4.   System uses random branch names and squashes commits when merging to main\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced: Git Power Users**: Since dialogs are .ipynb files, use full git workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `git init` in terminal for manual control\n",
    "*   `git commit` regularly with meaningful messages\n",
    "*   `git checkout` to revert to earlier states\n",
    "*   `git branch` for experimental work\n",
    "*   Full git history and all standard git commands available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto-save Behavior**: Dialogs save automatically every time you submit or cancel a new or edited message, and also during pretty much all actions that read or modify the dialog. This ensures your work is continuously persisted to disk. Use checkpoints or git before major changes for version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clearing Outputs**: No built-in \"clear all outputs\" feature. Restarting only clears variables, not visual outputs. Workarounds: 1) Edit individual outputs with `n`, 2) Use `Shift+O` to clamp output height, 3) Create new dialog for clean slate, or 4) Programmatically edit .ipynb JSON (backup first!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editing Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use the `n` key to edit individual outputs, or click the message title bar directly\n",
    "*   **Only AI prompt outputs are editable** - code cell outputs cannot be edited\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminal & Python Environment\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal Sessions**: Can disconnect due to websocket timeouts or inactivity. Latest version has \"Terminal websocket reconnection\" improvements. If unresponsive, try refreshing (Cmd/Ctrl+R) to get latest version with better stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Caching**: Use `%load_ext autoreload` and `%autoreload 2` at start of notebook. Automatically reloads modules when files change, eliminating need for manual kernel restarts or importlib.reload() when updating Python files through nbdev_export.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Support**: While optimized for Python, you can run other languages like Go, Rust, C using shell commands or Piston API for remote execution. Check David's demo at https://share.solve.it.com/d/cfdd46e50175569e95e55dcad9e1ccee for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript Testing**: Use `%%js` cell magic to run JavaScript in the browser. Put `%%js` at the top of a code cell, write JavaScript below, run with Shift+Enter. Check browser console (F12) for output. Use `%%html` for HTML snippets. For complex testing, use browser DevTools, create test routes, or run isolated FastHTML apps on port 8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Packages**: SolveIt instances run without root access, so `apt-get install` and similar system package managers are unavailable. Python packages work via `!pip install`. For system-level dependencies (compilers, libraries), use pre-built binaries, conda environments, or external platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries & Integrations\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claudette**: Answer.AI's wrapper for Anthropic's Claude API with stateful chat dialogs, convenient image support, simplified tool use, prompt caching, and reduced boilerplate. Offers deep Claude integration (prefill, extended thinking, server-side tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lisette**: Wraps LiteLLM for unified access to 100+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) with multi-provider flexibility and unified interface to switch between providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Imports & Functionality\n",

    "*   `import numpy as np` - Numerical computing: arrays, mathematical functions, linear algebra, random number generation\n",
    "*   `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` - Plotting: `plt.plot()`, `plt.scatter()`, `plt.hist()`, figure customization, subplots\n",
    "*   `import requests` - Simple HTTP requests: `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, JSON handling, session management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `tool_info()` - Displays available dialoghelper tools in a note for AI access to current dialog manipulation functions\n",
    "*   `render_ft()` - Makes FastHTML components render as HTML in cell outputs instead of showing object representations\n",
    "*   `show()` - Alternative to `render_ft()` for rendering FastHTML components as HTML in notebooks, with optional iframe wrapping and HTMX processing\n",
    "*   `JupyUvi(app, port=8000)` - Modern FastHTML server for SolveIt (preferred over deprecated `nb_serve`)\n",
    "*   `url2note(url)` - Fetches URL content and adds as markdown note below current message, useful for incorporating web content\n",
    "*   `add_msg(content, cell_type='note')` - Programmatically add messages to current dialog (note, code, prompt, raw)\n",
    "*   `find_msgs(pattern)` - Search dialog messages by content pattern, returns matching message indices\n",
    "*   `Chat()` - Create stateful Claude conversation that maintains context across multiple exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context & Message Management**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Context window**: SolveIt only sends messages _above_ the currently selected message to Claude as context. Working at the bottom includes MORE context (all messages above), while working higher up includes LESS context. Adding messages earlier doesn't increase context for subsequent prompts.\n",
    "*   **Pinning messages**: Serves three purposes: 1) **Context preservation** - pinned messages stay available even when long dialogs get truncated due to token limits, 2) **Export control** - pinned messages are excluded from exports (Python files, gists, published dialogs), 3) **Bulk management** - pinning a collapsed header pins all child messages too. Use for API docs, examples, and reference materials.\n",
    "*   **Hiding messages**: Use the 👁️ button to hide individual messages from AI context. Like pinning, hiding also propagates to child messages when you hide a collapsed/folded section. To hide children but keep the heading visible: fold the section → hide it (propagates to all children) → unfold → unhide just the heading.\n",
    "*   **Find/search**: Press `F` when in selection mode (not editing) to open find modal. Supports regex search, filtering by message type, and searches both inputs and outputs (including collapsed content). When a match is found inside a collapsed section, it will automatically be expanded. The colored buttons in the find modal filter messages by type (note/prompt/code/raw) - the colors match those used in the SolveIt UI. Press `Shift+F` to clear filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment & Hosting\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Options**: For small-medium apps use pla.sh (Answer.AI's deployment platform). For larger scale (100k+ users), Jeremy recommends dedicated servers from companies like Hetzner to keep things simple without opaque third-party proprietary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Hosting**: Not supported. According to Answer.AI team: \"We currently do not support self hosting and we dont have plans to do that as of now.\" SolveIt is cloud-only with free access through December 2025, then ~$10/month.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU Workloads**: SolveIt has 2GB storage limit, so use external platforms like Modal/Colab for GPU operations. The community has created excellent dialogs showing how to use Modal - check published gists and shared dialogs for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discord Integration\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**SolveItBuddy Activation**: Only activates when someone starts a message with `!ask` (normal helpful mode) or `!asks` (sassy mode). It does NOT activate automatically - only responds to these explicit commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Troubleshooting\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Debugging Step**: Use Chrome browser with all extensions disabled (easiest way is to use a guest profile). Browser extensions (especially Bitwarden, password managers) are the main source of keyboard shortcut conflicts and interface issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working**: Try Chrome guest profile first. Known conflicts on macOS: CMD+Shift+L, Option+Enter, CMD+Shift+/ may conflict with browser extensions or system shortcuts. If shortcuts fail, refresh the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can't Interact With Imported Notebook**: If you can open a notebook but can't run cells or edit, the issue is usually problematic outputs (especially from JupyUvi/FastHTML apps) or cell inputs containing HTML/HTMX/CSS/JS that interferes with the interface. Solution: Open in Jupyter and clear all outputs, then re-import. To debug which cell is problematic: open in Jupyter, delete half the cells, test if it works, then keep halving the problematic section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duplicate Dialogs**: Dialog duplicates can occur due to auto-save sync issues or browser/connection problems. Since dialogs are .ipynb files, safely delete duplicates from your dashboard - keep the one with your actual work. If this persists, refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl+R) to get the latest version with sync fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download Files**: In the dialog overview page, toggle \"See all files\" to show your files. Click the menu button (three dots) next to any file and select the download button to download directly to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secrets Not Loading**: Secrets are loaded when you open a dialog or terminal session. After adding a secret in the dashboard, open a new dialog or terminal and the environment variable will be available. Verify with `import os; os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Course Information\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course Timeline**: The SolveIt course started November 3rd, 2024 and runs for 5 weeks (2 lessons per week). Registration remained open for 2 weeks after the start date. After the course finishes, SolveIt will be free through December 2025, then around $10/month starting in 2026.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Live Sessions**: Check your dashboard at https://solve.it.com/dashboard for lesson session times automatically converted to your local timezone. Office hours are announced in Discord (typically in #solvers channel) but not listed on the dashboard. The Discord calendar can be unreliable for timezone conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homework Submission**: Share completed work and homework submissions in the Discord #share-it channel or the relevant lesson channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer.AI Team**: Answer.AI staff includes Jeremy Howard (jeremyhoward), Johno Whitaker (johnowhitaker), Erik Gaasedelen (erikgaas.), Nate (nate.dawgg), Alexis (algal0), Kerem (turgutluk), Tommy (tommyc.xyz), Eric Ries, Rens (rensdimmendaal), and Curtis (frax___). Jeremy and Johno are the most active in Discord support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Resources**: Jeremy's personal development and software craft resources are linked in the Lesson 1 YouTube description and the #announcements channel on Discord.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictation Tools**: Jeremy recommends MacWhisper (especially with the Parakeet model) for Mac users. Windows users should use the built-in \"voice typing\" feature. For better accuracy with technical terms, use MacWhisper's \"AI-Service\" feature with an LLM (like free Gemini from Google) for smart transcript fixups using custom prompts, rather than basic dictionary replacements.\n",

    "\n",
    "FAQ\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I pass a full directory as context to SolveIt?** A: Use `toolslm.xml.folder2ctx()` (recommended by Answer.AI). Install with `!pip install toolslm`, then use `from toolslm.xml import folder2ctx`. Example: `folder2ctx('/app/data/my_folder', file_glob='*.md')` returns XML-formatted context optimized for Claude. Supports filtering by file type, recursive search, and regex patterns. See docs: https://answerdotai.github.io/toolslm/xml.html#folder2ctx\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use OAuth APIs like Spotify in SolveIt?**\n",
    "\n",
    " A: SolveIt can't open browsers for OAuth authorization flows. Pre-authorize on your local machine to get access/refresh tokens, then add them to your Secrets section. Most OAuth libraries support token-based authentication without requiring browser flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I scrape JavaScript-heavy websites in SolveIt?** A: SolveIt's 2GB RAM/storage limits prevent running browser automation tools like Playwright or Selenium. For JavaScript-heavy sites, use **Browserbase** (recommended by Answer.AI) or other remote browser services. For simple scraping, use `requests`/`httpx` with `beautifulsoup4` (pre-installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the recommended library for audio work in SolveIt?** A: Use **torchaudio** (recommended by Jeremy). Install with `!pip install torchaudio torchvision`. Jeremy's demo shows audio playback works even in published dialogs: https://share.solve.it.com/d/afbc25f1f3d1ea7bcf55a8320e9b62b3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the recommended way to serve FastHTML/FastAPI apps in SolveIt?**\n",
    "\n",
    " A: Use `JupyUvi` for both FastHTML and FastAPI apps. Example for FastAPI: `from fastapi import FastAPI; app = FastAPI(); @app.get(\"/\") def home(): return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}; server = JupyUvi(app)`. Then visit your instance's public URL from the dashboard. JupyUvi automatically picks up new routes without server restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the idiomatic way to define routes in FastHTML?** A: FastHTML uses function names for route paths. For the root route, use `@rt` with a function named `index`: `@rt\n",
    "def index(): return \"Homepage\"`. You can also explicitly specify paths like `@rt(\"/about\")`, but FastHTML automatically maps function names to routes (e.g., `def about()` → `/about`). This is different from FastAPI - don't assume they work the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use the index route (`/`) for my FastHTML app in SolveIt?** A: No. SolveIt itself uses the root route (`/`) to display the SolveIt interface. If you define `@rt\n",
    "def index()` in your app, visiting the root URL will redirect you to SolveIt's interface, not your app. Use a different route like `@rt\n",
    "def homepage()` (accessible at `/homepage`) as your app's entry point. When you download and run locally with `serve()`, you can change it back to `index` for the standard `/` route.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I get an Anthropic API key?** A: Go to console.anthropic.com → sign up/log in → navigate to API Keys section → generate new key → add $5 minimum credit → copy key to SolveIt dashboard Secrets section as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Open a new dialog or terminal after adding the secret for it to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Do I need to restart my instance after adding secrets (API keys)?** A: No, you don't need to restart the instance. Secrets are loaded when you open a dialog or terminal session. After adding a secret in the dashboard, simply open a new dialog or terminal and the environment variable will be available. You can verify with `import os; os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')` in a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do I get \"NameError: name 'm' is not defined\" when using Chat(m, tools=...)?** A: The variable `m` needs to be defined as a model from the `models` list. Add `m = models[1]` (or models[0], models[2], etc.) before creating the Chat. The `models` list is automatically imported with `from claudette import *`. Some shared dialogs may be missing this setup line - look for `m = models[2]` further down in the dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why does nbdev_export only export some of my functions?** A: Most common cause: duplicate function names with `#| export` tags. Check with `grep -n \"^def \" your_notebook.ipynb`. Note: Hiding messages (👁️) only affects AI context, not nbdev_export. To exclude functions from export, use Cmd+Slash to comment them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can SolveItBuddy read shared dialog URLs?** A: Yes! SolveItBuddy can read shared SolveIt dialog URLs using the read_url tool. The shared dialogs are accessible and can be summarized or analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why does SolveItBuddy sometimes respond with \"None\"?** A: This happens when tool usage is exhausted and there isn't time to output a written response to the user. It's a technical limitation in the response generation process, not necessarily related to content access issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How are tools defined in SolveIt and why do I get \"tool not found\" errors?** A: Tools in SolveIt are defined using regular Python functions with docstrings and type annotations - no decorators needed. They have nothing to do with claudette. SolveIt supports fastcore's docments syntax for parameter documentation (same-line comments are optional). The \"tool not found\" errors occur when the code cells that define or import these functions haven't been executed yet. Simply run the cells containing your function definitions before using them with the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What does \"{symbol} not found. Did you run it?\" error mean?** A: This error means that `&symbol` appears somewhere in a note or prompt, which tells the AI that a function named `symbol` is available as a tool, but that symbol isn't defined in the Python namespace. It usually means that the code to define or import the function hasn't been run yet. For fastcore tools like `rg`, `str_replace`, `sed`, etc., you need to run `from fastcore.tools import *` first to make them available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I create custom line/cell magics in SolveIt?** A: Yes! Create custom magics with `@line_magic` and `@cell_magic` decorators from IPython.core.magic. SolveIt uses ipykernel (so IPython magics work) but not Jupyter Notebook/Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do `?` and `??` show the same thing in SolveIt instead of docs vs source code?** A: Import `from fastcore.docments import get_source` to get proper source code inspection. Use `get_source(function_name)` for source code viewing, which is what `??` should do in course examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I get parameter info for functions in SolveIt?** A: Press **Shift+Tab** while typing a function name to see parameter information and documentation. This works like standard Jupyter/IPython behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I accept code completion suggestions in SolveIt?** A: SolveIt has two types of code completion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Symbol dropdown** (list of available variables/functions): The dropdown should auto-open as you type. Press **Cmd+I** to manually request it to open. Press **Tab** to select from the dropdown list.\n",
    "2.   **GhostText AI suggestions** (inline grey text): Press **Right Arrow** to accept the AI-generated code completion\n",
    "\n",
    "GhostText only works in Standard/Concise modes (disabled in Learning mode) and was significantly improved in the Nov 9th update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is Jeremy's teaching approach for the SolveIt course?** A: Jeremy uses the **fast.ai top-down teaching method** (not bottom-up) that they've refined over nearly a decade, based on Harvard research by education expert David Perkins. Students start with working examples and gradually break them down layer by layer. Students should **actively experiment with the code at each step** down the abstraction hierarchy, not just watch. There's executable code from the very start - by using and understanding the highest levels first, the context is understood for each subsequent layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How can I bookmark or save Discord messages for later reference?** A: Discord lacks proper bookmarking, but several workarounds exist: 1) Right-click message → \"Copy Message Link\" to get jump URLs you can save elsewhere, 2) Create your own Discord server and forward important messages to it for organization, 3) Use Discord's search function with keywords, 4) Screenshot and save messages, or 5) Copy content to external note-taking apps like Notion or Obsidian.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What are the instance sharing and access options in SolveIt?** A: SolveIt provides three ways to share/access instances from the dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Copy Public URL** - Copies the public URL for web apps running on port 8000 (format: `https://abc123def456.solveit.com/`). Only one public URL per instance. Visitors can see the app but NOT access your code/dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   **Share button** - Opens dialog to add users by email. Shared users can access and collaborate on your instance code/dialogs (requires SolveIt account login).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   **Allow Guests checkbox** - Enables public access to your entire instance. Anyone with the URL can view, edit, and run ALL dialogs without authentication. Equivalent to \"share with everyone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice: Use dedicated instances for collaboration with guest mode, keep main work in private instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I access my JupyUvi app publicly?** A: After running `JupyUvi(app)` on port 8000, go to solve.it.com/dashboard and click \"Copy Public URL\" to get the actual public URL. You cannot use localhost:8000 or get the URL from the JupyUvi instance itself - the dashboard is the only way to get the public URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How can I set up Tailscale to connect SolveIt with my local machine?** A: Check out Mat Miller's comprehensive shared dialog at https://share.solve.it.com/d/33792186a41abf38e1bc5a7ab3ec939c which covers setting up SSH, Tailscale, WebDAV file sharing, and Cloudflare Tunnels in SolveIt. This enables secure networking between SolveIt and your local machines, including running code interactively on remote compute like GPU workstations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why did I find duplicate dialogs in my dashboard?** A: Most commonly, you accidentally pressed the `d` key which duplicates the selected dialog. You can safely delete unwanted duplicates from your dashboard. In rare cases, duplicates can occur due to auto-save sync issues - if this persists, refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl+R) to get the latest version with sync fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I use the checkpoint button in SolveIt?** A: First click \"Enable versioning\" to set up git for your dialog folder. After that, the button changes to \"checkpoint\" which lets you create manual git commits with custom messages. SolveIt auto-saves dialogs but does NOT auto-commit. Pressing `s` manually saves and commits to git. The checkpoint system uses random branch names and squashes commits when merging to main.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I include variable values in AI context?** A: Use dollar backticks like `$`varname`in prompts to include variable contents. When you use `$`varname` in a prompt, SolveIt evaluates the variable and sends only the current value to the AI. If you later change the variable and use `$`varname`` again, only the new value is sent - the old value is NOT preserved in the conversation history. The AI only sees whatever the current value is at the time each prompt is sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I display images in SolveIt notebooks?** A: Use `/static/` URLs in FastHTML components - they map to `/app/data/`. Example: `Img(src='/static/myapp/image.png')` accesses `/app/data/myapp/image.png`. Upload via \"show all files\" or terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Are collapsed cells included when publishing dialogs?** A: No, collapsed cells don't appear in published dialogs. Expand all cells you want visible before publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I provide images and PDFs to AI prompts?** A: **Images**: Paste directly into Note or Prompt messages - SolveIt automatically makes them available to Claude. Pasted images are embedded directly into the dialog's .ipynb file as base64-encoded data. **PDFs**: Cannot be pasted directly. Extract text using Python libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber) or copy/paste content manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where are pasted images into cells saved?** A: Pasted images are embedded directly into the dialog's .ipynb file as base64-encoded data. They're not saved as separate files on disk - the image data becomes part of the notebook JSON structure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I disable or override built-in tools like read_url and websearch?** A: Yes, you can override built-in tools by defining functions with the same names in your Python namespace. For example, `def read_url(*args, **kwargs): return \"Disabled\"` would shadow the built-in read_url tool. This works because Python's normal namespace resolution applies - user-defined functions override built-ins. Note: Importing different versions of functions like `read_link` from contextkit can also interfere with built-in tool behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I unpublish a dialog once it's published?** A: Republish an empty dialog with the same file path to replace content, or contact Answer.AI team through Discord for manual removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where can I submit feature requests, bug reports, or feedback for SolveIt?** A: Use the **#solveit-app** channel in Discord - this is where the Answer.AI team (especially Jeremy Howard) actively sees and responds to feature requests, bug reports, and suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How long is the SolveIt course?** A: The course started November 3rd, 2024 and runs for 5 weeks (2 lessons per week). Registration remained open for 2 weeks after the start date (until approximately November 17th). After the course finishes, SolveIt will be free through December 2025, then around $10/month starting in 2026.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Do SolveIt instances share resources or get individual allocations?** A: Each instance gets its own separate 2GB RAM and 2GB storage allocation - resources are NOT shared across instances. You can create multiple instances for different projects, and each one operates independently with full resource isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I export selected cells to markdown?** A: Use the export button on messages to mark them for export, then click \"Publish\" to get a shareable URL. Add \".md\" to the published URL to view the markdown version of your exported cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can Mac users use Keyboard Maestro to fix international keyboard shortcut issues?** A: Yes! For international Mac users experiencing keyboard shortcut conflicts (like German keyboards where Cmd+Shift+Comma/Period don't work), **Keyboard Maestro** macros can intercept the problematic key combinations and execute the correct SolveIt commands. This avoids editing source files or dealing with browser cache tradeoffs. Create macros that detect the intended shortcuts and trigger the appropriate SolveIt actions programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I split a long AI response into multiple messages?** A: Use the \"Split Message\" keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+Minus** on all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux). Place your cursor where you want to split the message while editing, then use the shortcut to break it into separate messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I increase font size in SolveIt?** A: Use your browser's zoom (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus) to increase all text sizes. SolveIt has theme settings but specific font size controls may vary by version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I resize the editor input field for more typing space?** A: Click the button with diagonal arrows on the far-right of the editor header, or use **Cmd+Shift+X** (Mac) / **Windows+Shift+X** (Windows) while in the editor to expand/shrink the editor to a larger height.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I get help with programming tasks in SolveIt?** A: For programming questions, **ask the AI directly inside SolveIt** - it can interact with you as you work on the problem, see your code, and help debug in real-time. This is much more effective than asking in Discord. For general SolveIt features/usage questions, use `!ask` in Discord to get help from SolveItBuddy (check the FAQ at https://fresh-bridge-completes-rnh.si.answer.ai/). For hands-on learning, copy the comprehensive features guide (https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.md) into a Note message in your dialog and ask SolveIt questions about specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What do the grey numbers after \"Output:\" in code cells mean?** A: The grey numbers after \"Output:\" show **token counts** for AI prompt responses, not execution order. They indicate how many tokens were used in that particular AI response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I download a file from SolveIt?** A: In the dialog overview page, toggle \"See all files\" to show your files. Click the menu button (three dots) next to any file and select the download button to download it directly to your local machine. No need to move files to static folders or use HTTP access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where do uploaded files go in SolveIt?** A: Files uploaded to SolveIt go to `/app/data/` by default - this is the SolveIt home directory and the \"root\" path shown in the dialog list screen. However, if you're currently in a subdirectory when you upload files, they'll be saved to that subdirectory instead. Use `ls` or `ls -la` in terminal to locate uploaded files, or click \"show all files\" in the dialog overview page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why can't I interact with an imported notebook in SolveIt?** A: If you can open a notebook but can't run cells, edit, or interact with it, the issue is usually problematic outputs (especially from JupyUvi/FastHTML apps) or cell inputs containing HTML/HTMX/CSS/JS that interferes with the SolveIt interface. **Solution**: Open the notebook in Jupyter and clear all outputs, then re-import to SolveIt. To debug which cell is problematic: open in Jupyter, delete half the cells, test if it works, then keep halving the problematic section until you find the specific cell causing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Does SolveIt support spell-checking in the editor?** A: No. SolveIt uses Monaco editor (same as VS Code), which doesn't support native browser spell-check. **Best workaround**: Add a prompt below your message asking \"Fix spelling and grammar in the message above. Keep changes minimal. Improve flow if broken. Output markdown.\" Then copy the corrected output back. This teaches you better writing while using SolveIt's AI. Alternative: Try browser extensions (Grammarly, LanguageTool) though compatibility varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I copy code blocks from AI responses in SolveIt?** A: Press the **`m` key** when a message is selected to copy code blocks from AI responses. SolveIt has a built-in copy code button feature, similar to ChatGPT's \"copy code\" functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do I get \"The following vars are undefined: [varname]\" error?** A: You're using `$`varname`(dollar backticks) somewhere in a note or prompt to reference a variable that doesn't exist in your Python namespace. Either remove the `$`varname` reference or define the variable in a code cell before that message (e.g., `varname = \"something\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I stop a long-running code cell without restarting the kernel?** A: Press **Shift+S** to interrupt the currently executing code or AI cell. This stops execution without restarting the kernel or losing your variables - much better than using Shift+R which restarts the entire kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When should I use Raw messages in SolveIt?** A: Raw messages (toggle with Cmd+Shift+;) are ideal for pasting large docs as AI context - they don't create sidebar headings, trigger dollar-backtick variables, or apply formatting. Also useful for Quarto frontmatter (YAML metadata). Access content with `x = read_msg()['msg']['content']` (requires `from dialoghelper import *`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I convert HTML or web pages to markdown?** A: Multiple options: 1) **url2note(url)** - Built-in SolveIt function (from dialoghelper import *) that fetches URL content and adds as markdown note below current message, 2) **r.jina.ai** - Prefix any URL with r.jina.ai/ (e.g., r.jina.ai/https://example.com) for instant markdown conversion, 3) **web2md.answer.ai** - Answer.AI's tool using html2text and trafilatura engines (GitHub: AnswerDotAI/web2md), 4) **Python libraries** - Install html2text or markdownify for programmatic conversion. For HTML to FastHTML code conversion, use h2f.answer.ai.\n"

    "## About FastHTML\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from fasthtml.common import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn,\n",
    "HTMX, and fastcore’s `FT` “FastTags” into a library for creating\n",
    "server-rendered hypermedia applications. The\n",
    "[`FastHTML`](https://www.fastht.ml/docs/api/core.html#fasthtml) class\n",
    "itself inherits from `Starlette`, and adds decorator-based routing with\n",
    "many additions, Beforeware, automatic `FT` to HTML rendering, and much\n",
    "more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to remember when writing FastHTML apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Not* compatible with FastAPI syntax; FastHTML is for HTML-first apps,\n",
    "  not API services (although it can implement APIs too)\n",
    "- FastHTML includes support for Pico CSS and the fastlite sqlite\n",
    "  library, although using both are optional; sqlalchemy can be used\n",
    "  directly or via the fastsql library, and any CSS framework can be\n",
    "  used. MonsterUI is a richer FastHTML-first component framework with\n",
    "  similar capabilities to shadcn\n",
    "- FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla\n",
    "  JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte\n",
    "- Use [`serve()`](https://www.fastht.ml/docs/api/core.html#serve) for\n",
    "  running uvicorn (`if __name__ == \"__main__\"` is not needed since it’s\n",
    "  automatic)\n",
    "- When a title is needed with a response, use\n",
    "  [`Titled`](https://www.fastht.ml/docs/api/xtend.html#titled); note\n",
    "  that that already wraps children in\n",
    "  [`Container`](https://www.fastht.ml/docs/api/pico.html#container), and\n",
    "  already includes both the meta title as well as the H1 element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimal App\n",
    "\n",
    "The code examples here use fast.ai style: prefer ternary op, 1-line\n",
    "docstring, minimize vertical space, etc. (Normally fast.ai style uses\n",
    "few if any comments, but they’re added here as documentation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal FastHTML app looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "## FastTags (aka FT Components or FTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "FTs are m-expressions plus simple sugar. Positional params map to\n",

    "        **{'@click':\"alert('Clicked');\"},         # Dict unpacking for attributes with special chars\n",
