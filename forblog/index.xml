  <title>What I Learned during my Second and Third Internships</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/21_reflecting_on_my_internships/thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="a continuously expanding brain; there are lots of swirls swirling around the brain"></p>
<p>I recently completed my second and third internships. These were quite hands on, and involved tasks such as finetuning LLMs to generate Cantonese lyrics to the topic and tones specified. Along the way, I learned <em>a lot</em>. Three months ago, I would not have been able to do what I did. You learn by doing.</p>
<p>Let’s list out some of the things I learned (in no particular order).</p>
<section id="training-strategies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-strategies">Training Strategies</h3>
<p>I know it sounds really obvious, but one should never start the finetuning process on the full dataset with the largest model variant right out of the box. There will be issues. One may be under the assumption that they’ve implemented the tweaks they needed to on the model, in the first attempt. Or that the data is correctly processed and formatted. However, chances are that they’re not. Save time, money, and resources by finetuning on on a small subset of the data with a smaller model variant. Once it is known the whole process works correctly and as expected, then go ahead with the full finetune.</p>
</section>
<section id="bpe-tokenizers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bpe-tokenizers">BPE Tokenizers</h3>
<p>Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers are “dynamic” tokenizers. That is, they do not tokenize text according to a preset vocabulary or set of rules. Rather, they tokenize according to an algorithm. In short, frequent sequences of characters are merged together to form tokens. These tokenizers also store their vocabulary in a data type known as byte strings.</p>
</section>
<section id="gpus" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gpus">GPUs</h3>
<p>There are various types of GPUs. I got to try out the mighty A100 all the way to reliable T4. I found the L4 and 4090 to be the sweet spot, though I’d lean towards the latter. Also, if you’re simply going after a GPU, don’t go for the major cloud providers such as Google Cloud. The only reason our company was using Google Cloud was because they had obtained free credits. Otherwise, it’s, well, a rip off when compared to <a href="https://cloud-gpus.com/">other providers</a> (in the context of research).</p>
</section>
<section id="forward-hooks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forward-hooks">Forward Hooks</h3>
<p>A hook is a piece of code that can be inserted at predefined places of an algorithm to achieve extra functionality. In the context of deep learning, a forward hook is a piece of code that is run after the forward pass of a model. By creating a forward hook, one can directly play around with and tweak the computed logits before the loss is calculated.</p>
</section>
<section id="token-generation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="token-generation">Token Generation</h3>
<p>With Hugging Face, at least, the way models generate tokens during training and inference is different. During training, all output tokens are generated simultaneously whereas during inference, generation occurs token by token.</p>
<p>However, as I dug behind the scenes of the builtin <code>generate</code> method, I found that during inference, all tokens were actually generated simultaneously–in a way. Say, if 10 tokens were to be generated, for each token, 10 tokens would be generated with the remaining 9 being “filler” tokens.</p>
</section>
<section id="logit-processors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logit-processors">Logit Processors</h3>
<p>Logit processors are nifty objects that Hugging Face provides to be able to conveniently tweak a model’s logits during inference with the builtin <code>generate</code> method.</p>
</section>
<section id="handling-mistakes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="handling-mistakes">Handling Mistakes</h3>
<p>Mistakes happen. Especially for challenging tasks. That’s normal. Mistakes should happen. What’s important is that one learns from their mistakes.</p>
</section>
<section id="fsdp" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fsdp">FSDP</h3>
<p>Fully Sharded Data Parallel is a technique for splitting a model across multiple GPUs. Imagine literally splitting a model’s parameters into a bunch of different groups, and then putting those groups onto multiple GPUs that run simultaneously. When a layer is being computed on a GPU, all relevant parameters are copied to that GPU.</p>
</section>
<section id="lora" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lora">LoRA</h3>
<p>Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a LLM finetuning technique in which new layers are added onto the head of the existing model. These new layers are then trained to achieve a specific task, and form an, well, adapter of sorts. Think of a screwdriver handle onto which you can attach various heads, each head achieving a specific task. In the context of LLMs, these specific tasks could be increasing the performance of a model, reducing its resource usage, or changing what sort of output it generates.</p>
</section>
<section id="quantization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quantization">Quantization</h3>
<p>Quantization is a LLM inference technique whereby the weights in the remaining few layers of the model are stored in 4 or fewer bits, as opposed to the more typical 16 or 32 bits. This allows more weights to be stored in the same amount of memory, and larger models to be fit on smaller hardware, all whilst retaining the relative same level of performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="reading-papers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-papers">Reading Papers</h3>
<p>When browsing papers, one typically wants to read the abstract, headings, figures, and results. From this, one can determine whether a given paper is worthy for their goal or not.</p>
<p>When reading a paper, one wants to do it iteratively. In the first iteration, also only read the abstract, figures, and results. In the next iteration, read the paper but not with too much focus. Don’t understand something? That’s fine, move on. In the third iteration, start reading more closely and try to make sense of what is going on. Get bogged down? Spend some more time on it, but not too much more–save it for the next iteration. And so on. As you do more iterations, it may be helpful to rephrase or summarize what each section discusses. This allows you to find gaps in your knowledge and determine whether you understand what you just wrote.</p>
</section>
<section id="looping-and-slicing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looping-and-slicing">Looping and Slicing</h3>
<p>Loops can be immensely slow. I managed to deflate my training time from 10+ hours to around 2 hours by replacing two nested for loops with a single slicing operation.</p>
</section>
<section id="llm-training-data-formats" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="llm-training-data-formats">LLM Training Data Formats</h3>
<p>There are different ways LLM training data can be formatted. The Alpaca format uses <code>'###'</code> as the delimiter, while ChatML uses the tokens <code>'&lt;|im_start|&gt;</code> and <code>'&lt;|im_end|&gt;'</code> as the delimiters.</p>
</section>
<section id="best-performing-open-source-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="best-performing-open-source-models">Best Performing Open Source Models</h3>
<p>The best performing open source models come from the other side of the Pacific ocean; from China. The AI scene there is quite vibrant, with most of the actual advances happening there. If you look at the latest papers, most of the authors will be from there too. During my internships, I came across so many models I never had heard off that were well performers or had interesting perks or quirks. Qwen is the best performing open source model. Deepseek is the most cost effective endpoint that exists. Then there are so many other models such as InternLM, Yi, PhotoMaker, and more.</p>
</section>
<section id="refactoring" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3>
<p>Refactored code is abstracted code. Abstracted code is maintainable code. Abstracted code is understandable code. Abstracted code is good code.</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h3>
<p>It’s stating the obvious, but data matters. It actually does influence the quality or manner of the model output.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

They are wearing an orange robe and using a chisel to create intricate designs on wood. The setting blends elements of a forest and architectural columns, with dramatic lighting that accentuates the carver and their craft. The scene evokes a sense of both indoor and outdoor space, with a focus on the artistry of wood carving."></p>
<p>In this notebook, I will implement a neural network from scratch, and iteratively reimplement with PyTorch. That is, I will implement each element of the training and inference process from scratch, before then using the corresponding element in PyTorch. This notebook assumes a prior understanding of the flow and pieces of a neural network.</p>
<p>To recap, the complete training loop of a neural network looks like this.</p>

<p>Our implementation produces the same outputs as PyTorch’s implementation.</p>
<p>We now need to implement the activation function, which will be the ReLU (rectified linear unit). Any value less than 0 gets clipped to 0. There are multiple ways we can approach doing this, such as using <code>torch.max</code>.</p>

max(input) -&gt; Tensor

Returns the maximum value of all elements in the ``input`` tensor.

.. warning::
    This function produces deterministic (sub)gradients unlike ``max(dim=0)``

Args:
    input (Tensor): the input tensor.

Example::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = torch.randn(1, 3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a
    tensor([[ 0.6763,  0.7445, -2.2369]])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.max(a)
    tensor(0.7445)

.. function:: max(input, dim, keepdim=False, *, out=None) -&gt; (Tensor, LongTensor)
   :noindex:

Returns a namedtuple ``(values, indices)`` where ``values`` is the maximum
value of each row of the :attr:`input` tensor in the given dimension
:attr:`dim`. And ``indices`` is the index location of each maximum value found
(argmax).

If ``keepdim`` is ``True``, the output tensors are of the same size
as ``input`` except in the dimension ``dim`` where they are of size 1.
Otherwise, ``dim`` is squeezed (see :func:`torch.squeeze`), resulting
in the output tensors having 1 fewer dimension than ``input``.

.. note:: If there are multiple maximal values in a reduced row then
          the indices of the first maximal value are returned.

Args:
    input (Tensor): the input tensor.
    dim (int): the dimension to reduce.
    keepdim (bool): whether the output tensor has :attr:`dim` retained or not. Default: ``False``.

Keyword args:
    out (tuple, optional): the result tuple of two output tensors (max, max_indices)

Example::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = torch.randn(4, 4)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a
    tensor([[-1.2360, -0.2942, -0.1222,  0.8475],
            [ 1.1949, -1.1127, -2.2379, -0.6702],
            [ 1.5717, -0.9207,  0.1297, -1.8768],
            [-0.6172,  1.0036, -0.6060, -0.2432]])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.max(a, 1)
    torch.return_types.max(values=tensor([0.8475, 1.1949, 1.5717, 1.0036]), indices=tensor([3, 0, 0, 1]))

.. function:: max(input, other, *, out=None) -&gt; Tensor
   :noindex:

<p>Now comes the backward pass; the pass responsible for computing the gradients of our model’s weights.</p>
<p>For brevity, I will not explain why I compute the gradients the way I do. It can be taken that the way I compute them is due to the result of calculating the derivatives of the foward pass by hand. If you would like to explore how I did so, you can refer to my other blog post, <a href="../../forblog/posts/18_backprop_from_scratch.html">Backpropagation Explained using English Words*</a>.</p>

<p>When implementing backpropagation, it is better to implement the entire equation in pieces, by storing the result of each intermediate gradient. These intermediate gradients can then be reused to calculate the gradients of another variable.</p>
<p>Let’s prepare the pieces we’ll need and get started.</p>

<p>Currently, we have functions that each separately handle a part of the network. For instance, <code>mse</code> only computes its respective portion of the forward pass: the mean squared error. <code>backward</code> is a separate function that handles the backward pass for all pieces of the network.</p>
<p>Let us change how this works, so each piece of the network also handles its respective backward pass. This means, <code>mse</code> will have the ability to compute both its forward pass and backward pass.</p>

<p>The classes we have created have common functionality, meaning their is still room for further refactoring. In particular, all the classes store the forward pass arguments as attributes if needed, have a <code>__call__</code> dunder method that exectutes the forward pass, and a <code>backward</code> method for the backward pass.</p>

<p>And with that, this is the basic underlying paradigm in which PyTorch implements its components.</p>
<p>So let us now directly use PyTorch’s <code>nn.Module</code> to handle our components. There is an added benefit that <code>nn.Module</code> automatically keeps track of our gradients, so we do not need to implement the backward pass.</p>

<p>As I have defined <a href="../../dictionary/terms/cross_entropy_loss.html">here</a>, cross entropy loss simply involves taking the logarithm of the softmax function, and multiplying the results with the <a href="../../dictionary/terms/one_hot_encoding.html">one hot encoded</a> targets.</p>
<p><a href="../../dictionary/terms/softmax.html">Softmax</a>, a multi-class generalization of the sigmoid function, involves taking the exponent of each prediction, and dividing each resulting value with the sum of all predictions to the exponent.</p>

max(input) -&gt; Tensor

Returns the maximum value of all elements in the ``input`` tensor.

.. warning::
    This function produces deterministic (sub)gradients unlike ``max(dim=0)``

Args:
    input (Tensor): the input tensor.

Example::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = torch.randn(1, 3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a
    tensor([[ 0.6763,  0.7445, -2.2369]])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.max(a)
    tensor(0.7445)

.. function:: max(input, dim, keepdim=False, *, out=None) -&gt; (Tensor, LongTensor)
   :noindex:

Returns a namedtuple ``(values, indices)`` where ``values`` is the maximum
value of each row of the :attr:`input` tensor in the given dimension
:attr:`dim`. And ``indices`` is the index location of each maximum value found
(argmax).

If ``keepdim`` is ``True``, the output tensors are of the same size
as ``input`` except in the dimension ``dim`` where they are of size 1.
Otherwise, ``dim`` is squeezed (see :func:`torch.squeeze`), resulting
in the output tensors having 1 fewer dimension than ``input``.

.. note:: If there are multiple maximal values in a reduced row then
          the indices of the first maximal value are returned.

Args:
    input (Tensor): the input tensor.
    dim (int): the dimension to reduce.
    keepdim (bool): whether the output tensor has :attr:`dim` retained or not. Default: ``False``.

Keyword args:
    out (tuple, optional): the result tuple of two output tensors (max, max_indices)

Example::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = torch.randn(4, 4)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a
    tensor([[-1.2360, -0.2942, -0.1222,  0.8475],
            [ 1.1949, -1.1127, -2.2379, -0.6702],
            [ 1.5717, -0.9207,  0.1297, -1.8768],
            [-0.6172,  1.0036, -0.6060, -0.2432]])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.max(a, 1)
    torch.return_types.max(values=tensor([0.8475, 1.1949, 1.5717, 1.0036]), indices=tensor([3, 0, 0, 1]))

.. function:: max(input, other, *, out=None) -&gt; Tensor
   :noindex:

<p>All that is left now is to multiply our softmax predictions with the one hot encoded targets, and sum the resulting vector. However, due to the nature of our targets, we can employ a nifty trick that removes the need to create a tensor of one hot encoded targets: integer array indexing.</p>

Docstring:     
Holds submodules in a list.

:class:`~torch.nn.ModuleList` can be indexed like a regular Python list, but
modules it contains are properly registered, and will be visible by all
:class:`~torch.nn.Module` methods.

Args:
    modules (iterable, optional): an iterable of modules to add

Example::

    class MyModule(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.linears = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(10, 10) for i in range(10)])

        def forward(self, x):
            # ModuleList can act as an iterable, or be indexed using ints
            for i, l in enumerate(self.linears):
                x = self.linears[i // 2](x) + l(x)
            return x
Init docstring: Initializes internal Module state, shared by both nn.Module and ScriptModule.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset-and-dataloader">Dataset and Dataloader</h2>
<p>I sometimes get confuzzled between the two terms, with regard to what each component actually does. The best way to think about these terms is that a dataset simply stores data in a massive warehouse, while a dataloader takes data from the dataset and tosses them into crates known as batches.</p>
<p>As it currently is, we iterate through our dataset by obtaining a slice object, and then slicing out some data to form a batch.</p>

<p>We will now simplify how we approach this logic.</p>
<section id="dataset" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
<p>The first point of simplification is to create a single dataset that will return both a sample and its associated target, from a single index. This will prevent us from having to index into two separate tensors.</p>

<p>Sampling is the method by which the dataloader selects indices from the dataset to load. Sampling from the training set should be random (due to the nature of our data), but not for the validation set.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will need to create an additional class for the our dataloader; a component that tells the dataloader from which indices to load data from the dataset.</p>

Docstring:     
Data loader. Combines a dataset and a sampler, and provides an iterable over
the given dataset.

The :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` supports both map-style and
iterable-style datasets with single- or multi-process loading, customizing
loading order and optional automatic batching (collation) and memory pinning.

See :py:mod:`torch.utils.data` documentation page for more details.

Args:
    dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
    batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
        (default: ``1``).
    shuffle (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled
        at every epoch (default: ``False``).
    sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): defines the strategy to draw
        samples from the dataset. Can be any ``Iterable`` with ``__len__``
        implemented. If specified, :attr:`shuffle` must not be specified.
    batch_sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): like :attr:`sampler`, but
        returns a batch of indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with
        :attr:`batch_size`, :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`,
        and :attr:`drop_last`.
    num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
        loading. ``0`` means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
        (default: ``0``)
    collate_fn (Callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a
        mini-batch of Tensor(s).  Used when using batched loading from a
        map-style dataset.
    pin_memory (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will copy Tensors
        into device/CUDA pinned memory before returning them.  If your data elements
        are a custom type, or your :attr:`collate_fn` returns a batch that is a custom type,
        see the example below.
    drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch,
        if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
        the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last batch
        will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
    timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for collecting a batch
        from workers. Should always be non-negative. (default: ``0``)
    worker_init_fn (Callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called on each
        worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as
        input, after seeding and before data loading. (default: ``None``)
    generator (torch.Generator, optional): If not ``None``, this RNG will be used
        by RandomSampler to generate random indexes and multiprocessing to generate
        `base_seed` for workers. (default: ``None``)
    prefetch_factor (int, optional, keyword-only arg): Number of batches loaded
        in advance by each worker. ``2`` means there will be a total of
        2 * num_workers batches prefetched across all workers. (default value depends
        on the set value for num_workers. If value of num_workers=0 default is ``None``.
        Otherwise if value of num_workers&gt;0 default is ``2``).
    persistent_workers (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will not shutdown
        the worker processes after a dataset has been consumed once. This allows to
        maintain the workers `Dataset` instances alive. (default: ``False``)
    pin_memory_device (str, optional): the data loader will copy Tensors
        into device pinned memory before returning them if pin_memory is set to true.


.. warning:: If the ``spawn`` start method is used, :attr:`worker_init_fn`
             cannot be an unpicklable object, e.g., a lambda function. See
             :ref:`multiprocessing-best-practices` on more details related
             to multiprocessing in PyTorch.

.. warning:: ``len(dataloader)`` heuristic is based on the length of the sampler used.
             When :attr:`dataset` is an :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`,
             it instead returns an estimate based on ``len(dataset) / batch_size``, with proper
             rounding depending on :attr:`drop_last`, regardless of multi-process loading
             configurations. This represents the best guess PyTorch can make because PyTorch
             trusts user :attr:`dataset` code in correctly handling multi-process
             loading to avoid duplicate data.

             However, if sharding results in multiple workers having incomplete last batches,
             this estimate can still be inaccurate, because (1) an otherwise complete batch can
             be broken into multiple ones and (2) more than one batch worth of samples can be
             dropped when :attr:`drop_last` is set. Unfortunately, PyTorch can not detect such
             cases in general.

             See `Dataset Types`_ for more details on these two types of datasets and how
             :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` interacts with
             `Multi-process data loading`_.

.. warning:: See :ref:`reproducibility`, and :ref:`dataloader-workers-random-seed`, and
             :ref:`data-loading-randomness` notes for random seed related questions.

<p>Tokenization is the process whereby text is given a numerical representation. Sentences are split into components known as tokens. These tokens represent numerical values that language models can work with.</p>
<p>There are various approaches to tokenization. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>word-based tokenization</li>
<li>character-based tokenization</li>
<li>subword-based tokenization</li>
<li>and a whole lot more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Language models require the use of their own tokenization technique to properly work. Let’s have a look at three approaches.</p>
<section id="word-based" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-based">Word-based</h2>
<p>The word-based approach, well, splits sentences into individual words. In some cases, it also splits on punctuation.</p>
<p>In the example below, the sentence is tokenized into its words using whitespace.</p>
<div id="cell-6" class="cell" data-outputid="e2ac5d36-aca7-4b93-ecc1-a26600b00266" data-execution_count="1">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"I'm really excited doing this, you know?"</span>.split()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="1">
<pre><code>["I'm", 'really', 'excited', 'doing', 'this,', 'you', 'know?']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s see it split based on its punctuation.</p>
<div id="cell-8" class="cell" data-outputid="df4cc4a8-490f-4d3f-f2c2-5daa149303cd" data-execution_count="2">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;

<span id="cb3-2"></span>
<span id="cb3-3">seq <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"I'm really excited doing this, you know?"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">toks <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> re.findall(<span class="vs" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">r'\w+|[^\w\s]+'</span>, seq)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">;</span> toks</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="2">
<pre><code>['I', "'", 'm', 'really', 'excited', 'doing', 'this', ',', 'you', 'know', '?']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After tokenizing, an ID is assigned to each word, or token, so the model can identify them.</p>
<p>The issue with the word-based approach is wend up with huge vocabularies<sup>1</sup>, especially when splitting on punctuation. For instance, the English language has over 500,000 words, so we would also need more than 500,000 tokens.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;A vocabulary is a collection of tokens.</p></div><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Examples of such tokens include [UNK] or &lt;unk&gt;.</p></div></div><p>To remedy this, we could use only the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> most frequently used words However, the issue that arises here is when the tokenizer encounters a word not present in its vocabulary. In this situation, a token representing the concept of “unknown” would be assigned<sup>2</sup>. When there are many such tokens, the model has no way of “knowing” that these tokens in fact represent different words.</p>
<p>Another issue with this approach is that the tokenizer will assign words such as “car” and “cars” different tokens. The model will not know that these two words are actually similar and represent almost the same concept.</p>
</section>
<section id="character-based" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="character-based">Character-based</h2>
<p>This approach splits text into characters, resulting in a much, much smaller vocabulary – the English alphabet only has 26 letters, as opposed to hundreds of thousands of words. It also results in fewer unknown tokens as words are comprised from everything within the vocabulary.</p>
<div id="cell-12" class="cell" data-outputid="857f71cd-b624-4a43-ee6a-ae9028d267d8" data-execution_count="3">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">list</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"Who doesn't love tokenization!"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="3">
<pre><code>['W',
 'h',
 'o',
 ' ',
 'd',
 'o',
 'e',
 's',
 'n',
 "'",
 't',
 ' ',
 'l',
 'o',
 'v',
 'e',
 ' ',
 't',
 'o',
 'k',
 'e',
 'n',
 'i',
 'z',
 'a',
 't',
 'i',
 'o',
 'n',
 '!']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, this approach also has its drawbacks. Individual characters hold less meaning than a whole word. For example, ‘t’ holds less meaning than ‘tokenization’.</p>
<p>That said, this issue is not as prevalent in other languages. In Chinese languages, each character is also a word. Therefore, characters in Chinese languages hold less meaning than characters in Latin languages.</p>
<p>While there will be an overall smaller vocabulary, there will still be much processing to do – we end up with a large amount of individual tokens to process. ‘Hello!’ would need only a single token, where as ‘H’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’, and ‘!’ would require six tokens.</p>
</section>
<section id="subword-based" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subword-based">Subword-based</h2>
<p>This approach is a combination of the two approaches above, and is also the approach most state-of-the-art tokenizers use today.</p>
<p>With subword-based tokenizers, words fall into two categories: frequent words and rare words. Frequent words are not to be split, but rare words are to be split into meaningful subwords.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/19_tokenizers/1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For example, ‘tokenization’ would be categorized as a rare word and would be tokenized into the tokens ‘token’ and ‘ization’. Though one word is now represented by two tokens, as opposed to a single token with the word-based approach, it is split into two components that much more frequently appear. We also don’t need eleven tokens, as would be with the character-based approach. On top of that, the model would learn the grammatical function of ‘ization’.</p>
<p>This is all while giving the model the ability to learn the meaning of ‘realization’ as the two tokens that comprise the word appear next to each other</p>
<p>This approach allows us to have relatively good covereage for a language while having relatively smaller vocabularies. It also results in minimal unknown tokens.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokenizing-time">Tokenizing Time</h2>
<p>If we draw parallels between a tokenizer and a model, the algorithm of a tokenizer is akin to the architecture of a model. On a similar note, the vocabulary of a tokenizer is akin to the weights of a model.</p>

<p>Backpropagation sounds and looks daunting. It doesn’t need to be. In fact, backpropagation is really just a fancy word for the chain rule. Implementing a backpropagation algorithm is simply implementing one big fat chain rule equation.</p>
<p>Let’s remind ourselves of the chain rule. The chain rule lets us figure out how much a given variable indirectly changes with respect to another variable. Take the example below.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Balign%7D%0A%20%20y%20&amp;=%203u%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20u%20&amp;=%207%20+%20x%5E2%0A%5Cend%7Balign%7D%0A"></p>
<p>We want to figure out how much <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> changes with each increment in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">. The problem is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> doesn’t direcly change <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">. Rather, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> changes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> which in turn changes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">.</p>
<p>The chain rule allows us to solve this problem. In this case, the chain rule tells us that we can figure out how much <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> indirecly changes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> by multiplying the derivative of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> with respect to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">, and the derivative of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> with respect to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7Bdy%7D%7Bdx%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bdy%7D%7Bdu%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7Bdu%7D%7Bdx%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Aaand I’ve just described backpropagation in a nutshell. That’s all there really is to it. The only difference is that in a neural network there are many more intermediate variables and functions, and that we want to find out how the weights indirectly change the loss.</p>
<p>Let’s see this tangibly in action.</p>
<p>We have the following neural network comprised of two layers: the first layer contains the affine function<sup>1</sup> together with the ReLU, while the second layer contains only the affine function. The loss, which is MSE (Mean Squared Error), will then be calculated from the output of the second layer.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Affine function is a fancy name for the linear function</p></div></div><div class="cell" data-layout-align="default">

  end
  
  subgraph C [Loss Function]

  end
</pre>

<p>Mathematically speaking, the first layer with a single sample <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D(0,%20x%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bw%7D%7D_1%20+%20b_1)%0A"></p>
<p>The second layer looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D(0,%20x%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bw%7D%7D_1%20+%20b_1)%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bw%7D%7D_2%20+%20b_2%0A"></p>
<p>And the loss function looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B(y%20-%20(%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D(0,%20x%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bw%7D%7D_1%20+%20b_1)%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bw%7D%7D_2%20+%20b_2))%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%0A"></p>

<p>MSE in its most basic form looks like this. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BMSE%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B(y%20-%20x)%5E2%7D%7B1%7D%0A"></p>
<p>If we have multiple data points, then it looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BMSE%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B(y_1%20-%20x_1)%5E2+(y_2%20-%20x_2)%5E2+(y_3%20-%20x_3)%5E2%7D%7B3%7D%0A"></p>

<p>Our goal for the rest of this guide is to derive the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_1">.</p>
<p>The equation above looks quite the mouthful though. One might even say scary. How would you even apply the chain rule here? How would you use the chain rule to derive the gradients of the weights and biases?</p>
<p>Let’s simplify things by introducing a bunch of intermediate variables. We’ll begin by substituting the innermost pieces of the equation, and then gradually make our way out.</p>

<hr>
<p>When implementing backpropagation in a program, it is often better to implement the entire equation in pieces, as opposed to a single line of code, through storing the result of each intermediate gradient. These intermediate gradients can be reused to calculate the gradients of another variable, such as the bias <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_1">.</p>
<p>Instead of implementing the following in a single line of code.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u_5%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20u_4%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u_4%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20u_3%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u_3%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20u_2%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u_2%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20u_1%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u_1%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Cvec%7Bw%7D_1%7D%0A"></p>
<p>We can instead first calculate the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_4">.</p>

<p>Then calculate the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_3"> and multiply it with it with the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_4">.</p>

<p>Then multiply the product above with the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2">.</p>

<p>Then multiply the product above with the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1">.</p>

</div>
<p>First we need to calculate the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_4">.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="annotated-cell-2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-annotation-code code-with-copy code-annotated"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="annotated-cell-2-1">diff <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

</dl>
<p>Next are the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_3"></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1">diff.g <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>Then the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2"></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1">l2.g <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>The equation for the gradient of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_1"> is almost the same as the equation for the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_1">, save for the last line where we do not have to matrix multiply with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bx%7D%7D_i">. Therefore, we can reuse all previous gradient calculations to find the gradient of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_1">.</p>

<p>And that’s all there really is to backpropagation; think of it a one big chain rule problem.</p>
<p>To make sure you’ve got it hammered down, get out a pen and paper and derivate the equations that would compute the gradients of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bx%7D%7D_i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7B%5Crm%7Bw%7D%7D_2">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2"> respectively with respect to the MSE.</p>
<p>And if you really want to hammer down your understanding on what’s happening, then I highly recommend reading <a href="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/">The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning</a>. I’ve also <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/misc/matrix_calculus_practice.pdf">compiled backpropagation practice questions</a> from this paper!</p>

<p>Meanshift clustering is a technique for unsupervised learning. Give this algorithm a bunch of data and it will figure out what groups the data can be sorted into. It does this by iteratively moving all data points until they converge to a single point.</p>
<p>The steps of the algorithm can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For each data point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> in the dataset, calculate the distance between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and every other data point in the dataset.</li>
<li>Calculate weights for each point in the dataset by passing the calculated distances through the normal distribution.</li>
<li>Calculate the weighted average for all points in the dataset. This weighted average is the new location for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the data we will work with to illustrate meanshift clustering. The data points are put into clearly seperate clusters for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>From the shape of this graph, we can see that larger values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> give smaller values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">, which is what we want —&nbsp;longer distances should have smaller weights meaning they have a smaller effect on the new position of the point.</p>
<p>We can control the rate at which the weights go to zero by varying what’s known as the bandwidth, or the standard deviation. The graph above is generated with a bandwith of 2.5.</p>
<p>The graph below is generated with a bandwidth of 1.</p>

<p>This post covers einstein summation notation syntax in terms of programming languages.</p>

<p>Einstein summation notation (or einsum notation for short) is a handy way to write various matrix operations in a succinct, universal manner. With it, you can probably forget all the various symbols and operators there are and stick to one common syntax, that once understood, can be more intuitive.</p>
<p>For example, matrix multiplication can be written as <code>ik, kj -&gt; ij</code> and a transpose of a matrix can be written as <code>ij -&gt; ji</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s figure this out.</p>
<section id="general-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-rules">General Rules</h2>
<p>The following are two general rules one can use to quickly write einsum notation.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Repeating letters between input arrays means that values along those axes will be multiplied together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Omitting a letter from the output means that values along that axis will be summed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I don’t find these rules intuitive, even a little confusing. Why?</p>
<p>Matrices have the order of row by column. A 2x3 matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns. When we perform matrix multiplication, we take the dot product of each row in the first matrix with each column in the second matrix.</p>
<p>However, when the einsum rules above — specifically the first rule — are used to denote matrix multiplication (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ik,%20kj%20%5Crightarrow%20ij">, as depicted below), the order of a matrix appears to change.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/16_einstein_summation/1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In order for the einsum rules and the definition of matrix multiplcation above to stay consistent, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> now denotes the rows in the first matrix and columns in the second matrix, thereby changing the order of a matrix to column by row.</p>
<p>But even if we let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> denote the columns in the first matrix, we end up doing dot products with each <em>column</em> in the first matrix and with each <em>row</em> in the second matrix.</p>
<p>Not intuitive.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-more-intuitive-way" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-more-intuitive-way">A More Intuitive Way</h2>
<p>The key to understanding einsum notation is to not think of axes, but of iterators. For example, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> is an iterator that returns the rows of a matrix. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> is an iterator that returns the columns of a matrix.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a relatively more simple example: the hadamard product (also known as the elementwise product or elementwise multiplication.)</p>
<section id="hadamard-product" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hadamard-product">Hadamard Product</h3>
<p>We have the following two matrices.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AA%0A=%0A%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%0A1%20&amp;%202%20&amp;%203%20%5C%5C%0A4%20&amp;%205%20&amp;%206%20%5C%5C%0A7%20&amp;%208%20&amp;%209%0A%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D,%0AB%0A=%0A%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%0A9%20&amp;%208%20&amp;%207%20%5C%5C%0A6%20&amp;%205%20&amp;%204%20%5C%5C%0A3%20&amp;%202%20&amp;%201%0A%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%0A"></p>
<p>To access the element 8 in matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, we need to return the second row and first column<sup>1</sup>. This can be denoted as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_%7B21%7D">. The first digit in the subscript refers to the row and the second refers to the column. We can refer to any entry generally as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_%7Bij%7D">.</p>

<p>Matrix multiplication simply involves taking the dot product of each row in the first matrix with each column in the second matrix.</p>
<p>We’ll need to use 3 iterators for this: one iterator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> to loop through the rows of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, another iterator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> to loop through the columns of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, and a third iterator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> to loop through the elements in a row and column.</p>

<p>And that’s that! The key is to think in terms of iterators that return locations in a matrix.</p>
<p>It may help to implement the operations above by yourself through pencil and paper, and in a programming languge too.</p>

  <title>(Un)successfully Implementing DiffEdit</title>

<p>Well, my implementation was a partial success: I managed to generate a mask, but failed to apply it. If you don’t understand, hold on as I’ll explain DiffEdit.</p>
<p>In this notebook, I try to implement the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11427">DiffEdit</a> paper: a diffusion algorithm that allows us to replace the subject of an image with another subject, simply through a text prompt.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-simple callout-warning">

<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>This notebook does not closely follow the paper implementation of DiffEdit. However, it does capture the underlying mechanisms.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a nutshell, this is done by generating a mask from the text prompt. This mask cuts out the subject from the image, which allows a new subject to be added to the image.</p>
<p>While I was successful in generating a mask, I wasn’t successful in applying it to an image. So at the end of this notebook, I’ll use the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/inpaint">Hugging Face Stable Diffusion Inpaint Pipeline</a> to see the mask in action.</p>
<p>If you would like a refresher on how Stable Diffusion can be implemented from its various components, you can read my post on this <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/posts/13_implementing_stable_diffusion_from_its_components.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-workings">Basic Workings</h2>
<p>Let’s say we have an image of a horse in front of a forest. We want to replace the horse with a zebra. At a high level, DiffEdit achieves this in the following manner.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using our image, we generate a further image with the prompt ‘horse’.</li>
<li>We similarly generate another further image with the prompt ‘zebra’.</li>
<li>The difference between both generated images is then taken.</li>
<li>The difference is normalized<sup>1</sup> and binarized<sup>2</sup> to obtain the mask.</li>
<li>We again generate an image with the prompt ‘zebra’.
<ul>
<li>However this time, after each denoising step, apply the mask to the latent to obtain a cutout of the zebra.</li>
<li>Then add the noised background pixels of the original image to the cutout.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In this case, normalizing means scaling the values to be between 0 and 1.</p></div><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Binarizing means making values to be any of 2 possible values. In this case, either 0 or 1.</p></div></div></section>

<p>The kernel is essentially a shape. Multiple shapes are be applied to the image in order to perform transformations.</p>

<p>After asking on the fastai forum, and hours of fiddling about, the reason why this is happening is most likely due to the fact that I keep uncompressing and recompressing the latent. The compression that the VAE performs is lossy, so detail is lost during each compression and decompression.</p>
<p>My mask is not calculated in the same latent space as my latent. In other words, my mask was calculated as a 512x512 pixel and 3 channel image, whereas my latent is a 64x64 pixel and 4 channel image. I’m uncompressing the latent so that I can apply the mask to cutout the zebra and add the background pixels, and then recompressing.</p>
<p>To fix this, I would need to generate the mask as a 64x64 pixel and 3 channel image.</p>
<p>To at least see the mask in action, let’s use the Hugging Face Stable Diffusion Pipeline.</p>

<p>Looking back, the actual problem for me was that I let the paper feel intimidating; all those symbols, variables, jargon, and notation. I ended up glazing over the paper and missing the smaller details.</p>
<p>To help prevent this the next time, I should</p>
<ul>
<li>list out the variables and what they represent</li>
<li>write out the steps in simpler terms</li>
<li>and take a deep breath before reading, so I take things slowly.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s that.</p>

<p>In this notebook, we’ll implement stable diffusion from its various components through the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index">Hugging Face Diffusers</a> library.</p>
<p>At the end, we’ll have our own custom stable diffusion class, from which we can generate images as simply as <code>diffuser.diffuse()</code>.</p>
<p>If you would like a refresher, I’ve summarized at a high level how a diffuser is trained in <a href="../../forblog/posts/12_stable_diffusion_summarized.html">this</a> post. Though this notebook focuses on inference and not the training aspect, the linked summary may be helpful.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Before we get hands on with the code, let’s refresh how inference works for a diffuser.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We input a prompt to the diffuser.</li>
<li>This prompt is given a mathematical representation (an embedding) through the text encoder.</li>
<li>A latent comprised of noise is produced.</li>
<li>The U-Net predicts the noise in the latent in conjunction with the prompt.</li>
<li>The predicted noise is subtracted from the latent in conjunction with the scheduler.</li>
<li>After many iterations, the denoised latent is decompressed to produce our final generated image.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main components in use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a text encoder,</li>
<li>a U-Net,</li>
<li>and a VAE decoder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s make the diffuser output how the generated image looks like at each step interval (e.g., every 5 steps), if specified so.</p>
<p>To do so, we can simply tweak the <code>diffuser.diffuse()</code> method by make it output the latent at each desired interval.</p>

<p>And there you have it! All that’s happening is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A compressed, noisy image is generated.</li>
<li>The noise in the image is predicted.</li>
<li>The predicted noise is subtracted.</li>
<li>This is repeated until desired.</li>
<li>The final image is decompressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently began <a href="https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html">fastai Course Part 2</a>: a course where one dives into the deeper workings of deep learning by fully implementing stable diffusion.</p>
<p>In the first lesson, we play around with diffusers using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index">Hugging Face Diffusers</a> library. Below are things I have noticed; my musings.</p>
<section id="steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Diffusion is simply a process whereby noise is progressively removed from a noisy image. A single step can be thought of a single portion of noise being removed.</p>

<p>Below is the evolution of the image above in 48 steps. Each new image has less and less noise (what the diffuser thinks is noise).</p>

<p>It still managed to generate a pretty good image despite the misspelling of “intertwined”!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-it-doesnt-work-well">When It Doesn’t Work Well</h2>
<p>I’ve found that a diffuser doesn’t work well when one prompts it for things, which I assume, it hasn’t “seen” or hasn’t been trained on before. It sounds obvious, but it’s really interesting when you see the result of it.</p>

<p>A quick Google search also doesn’t return any images matching the prompt in the top results.</p>

<section id="cfg-classifier-free-guidance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cfg-classifier-free-guidance">CFG (Classifier Free Guidance)</h2>
<p>Or simply known as guidance, CFG is a value which tells the diffuser how much it should stick to the prompt.</p>
<p>A lower guidance leads to more varied and random images that are loosely related to the prompt. A higher guidance produces more relevant images.</p>
<p>I’ve found that too high of a guidenace leads to images having too much contrast.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">

<p>The image above shows rows with increasing levels of guidance (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 25, 50). 7.5 is the sweetspot.</p>

<section id="negative-prompts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-prompts">Negative Prompts</h2>
<p>The best way to think about negative prompts is that a negative prompt <em>guides</em> a diffuser away from generating a certain entity.</p>
<p>Take the image below as an example.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="../images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/negative_prompt_1.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-9" title="An antique 18th century painting of a gorilla eating a plate of chips."><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/negative_prompt_1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Another variation generated from the prompt, 'An antique 18th century painting of a gorilla eating a plate of chips.'

<figcaption>An antique 18th century painting of a gorilla eating a plate of chips.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I generated the image again using the exact same seed and prompt, but also used the following negative prompt, “yellow circle”.</p>

<section id="image-to-image" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="image-to-image">Image to Image</h2>
<p>Instead of starting from noise, one can make a diffuser begin from an existing image. The diffuser follows the image as guide and doesn’t match it 1 to 1.</p>
<p>I quickly mocked up the following image.</p>
<p><a href="../images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/img_to_img_0.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-11"><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/img_to_img_0.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Clip art of a bench and a tree behind a sky and on top of grass. There is the sun and a couple of clouds in the sky."></a></p>
<p>I input it to a diffuser with a prompt, and it output the following.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="../images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/img_to_img_1.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-12" title="A bench under a tree in a park"><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/img_to_img_1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A bench under a tree in a park"></a></p>
<figcaption>A bench under a tree in a park</figcaption>

<p>I then further generated another image from this one.</p>

<section id="further-adapting-a-diffuser" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="further-adapting-a-diffuser">Further Adapting a Diffuser</h2>
<p>There are two ways one can further customize a diffuser to produce desired images: textual inversion and dreambooth.</p>
<section id="textual-inversion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="textual-inversion">Textual Inversion</h3>
<p>A diffuser contains a text encoder. This encoder is responsible for parsing the prompt and giving it a mathematical representation.</p>
<p>A text encoder can only parse according to its vocabulary. If it encounters words not in its vocabulary, the diffuser will be unable to produce an image relevant to the prompt.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, textual inversion adds new words to the vocabulary of the text encoder so it can parse prompts with those new words.</p>
<p>I managed to generate the image below by adding the word “<a href="https://mrdoodle.com">Mr Doodle</a>” to the vocabulary of the diffuser’s text encoder.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="../images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/textual_inversion.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-14" title="An antique 18th century painting of a gorilla eating a plate of chips in the style of Mr Doodle"><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/11_musings_through_stable_diffusion/textual_inversion.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="An antique 18th century painting of a gorilla eating a plate of chips in the style of Mr Doodle"></a></p>

</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="dreambooth" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dreambooth">Dreambooth</h3>
<p>Dreambooth is more akin to traditional fine-tuning methods. A diffuser is further trained on images one supplies to it.</p>

<p>We start with an image and its description. The image encoder takes the image and produces a feature vector — a vector with numerical values that describe the image in some way. The text encoder takes the image’s description and similarly produces a feature vector.</p>
<p>These two feature vectors are then stored in what’s known as a CLIP embedding. An embedding is simply a table where each row is an item and each column describes the items in some way. In this case, the rows represent feature vectors, and the columns are each feature in the vector.</p>
<p>Both encoders keep producing feature vectors until they are as similar as possible.</p>

<p>Once the feature vectors have been produced, the image is compressed by the VAE autoencoder. Some noise is then tossed onto the image.</p>
<p>The VAE autoencoder contains an encoder and a decoder. The encoder handles compression whereas the decoder handles decompression.</p>
<p>The compressed noisy image is now known as the latent. The image is compressed for faster computation, as there would be fewer pixels to compute on.</p>

<p>The latent, together with its feature vector, is now input to the U-net. Instead of predicting what the original, un-noisy image was, the U-net predicts the noise that was tossed onto the image.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that’s all there is to it!</p>
<p>We take an image and its prompt, and create a feature vector out of them. The image is compressed and noise is then added to it. The latent and the feature vector are input to a U-net which then predicts the noise in the latent. The predicted noise is subtracted from the latent, which is then input back to the U-net. After the desired number of steps has lapsed, the latent is decompressed and the generated image is ready!</p>

<p>In the first <code>for</code> loop below, we loop through all the bird folders. For each folder, a folder with the same name is created in the directory where we want to store the images.</p>
<p>In the second <code>for</code> loop, we loop through all audio files within the folder and then convert them to spectrogram images through the <code>create_images</code> function I defined.</p>

<p>Again, since sample rate is the number of frames recorded per second, we can divide the total number of frames by the sample rate to obtain the duration in seconds of a clip.</p>
<p><code>duration = info.num_frames / info.sample_rate</code></p>
<p>Then we round the duration to the nearest 5 for easy clipping.</p>
<p><code>round(duration/5)*5</code></p>

  <title>Transformers, Simply Explained</title>
  <dc:creator>Salman Naqvi</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/9_transformers_explained/thumbnail.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A picture of Transformers — the ones that transform from a robot into cars — posing as English alphabets."></p>
<section id="at-a-high-view" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="at-a-high-view">At a High View</h2>
<p>Transformers are all the rage right now. They’re what’s powering the current wave of chat bots. Here’s a high level view of how transformers work, so you know how these bots really work.</p>
<p>Simply put, a transformer is a type of architecture used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that either fills-in-the-blanks or autocompletes.</p>
<p>Transformers consist of either an encoder, decoder, or both. Encoders and decoders contain attention layers.</p>
<p>Language models need numbers to work. Text is given a numerical representation after breaking it down into smaller pieces. To keep this explanation simple, these pieces are words.</p>
<p>The numerical representation given to a word describes the word itself and its relation to the surrounding words.</p>
</section>
<section id="encoders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="encoders">Encoders</h2>
<p>Encoder-only transformers are good for “understanding” text, such as classifying sentences by sentiment or figuring out what parts of a sentence refers, for example, to a person or location.</p>
<p>When training encoders, words are given a numerical representation by the attention layers considering adjacent words. For example, let’s say we have the sentence, “I am really hungry.”. The attention layers consider the words ‘am’ and ‘hungry’ when giving the word ‘really’ a numerical representation.</p>
<p>The goal of training encoders is to predict words omitted from text (e.g., “I … really hungry.”). This is how encoders can “understand” text.</p>
</section>
<section id="decoders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decoders">Decoders</h2>
<p>Decoder-only transformers are good for text generation. An example is the autocomplete feature on a smartphone’s keyboard.</p>
<p>Decoders similary give text a numerical representation, except that the attention layers consider only the previous words. When giving ‘am’ a numerical representation from “I am hungry.”, the attention layers will only consider the word ‘I’. When giving ‘hungry’ a numerical representation, the attention layers will consider the words ‘I’ and ‘am’.</p>
<p>The goal of training decoders is to predict the most likely word to continue a piece of text (e.g., “I am ….”). All generated words are used in conjunction to generate the next word.</p>
</section>
<section id="encoders-and-decoders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="encoders-and-decoders">Encoders and Decoders</h2>
<p>Transformers that use both encoders and decoders are known as encoder-decoder models or sequence-to-sequence models. Such models are good for translation and summarization.</p>
<p>Encoder-decoder models are trained by first letting the encoder give the input text a numerical representation. Next, this representation is input to the decoder which generates text as described above. The encoder part of the model provides the “understanding”, while the decoder part of the model generates based off of this “understanding”.</p>

<p>And there you have it! It’s as simple as that!</p>

  <title>A No Nonsense Guide on how to use an M-Series Mac GPU with PyTorch</title>

<p>If you have one of those fancy Macs with an M-Series chip (M1/M2, etc.), here’s how to make use of its GPU in PyTorch for increased performance.</p>
<p>It’s a bit annoying and a little tedious, but here we go.</p>
<section id="requirements" class="level2" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="requirements"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have an M-Series chip</li>
<li>Have at least PyTorch 1.12</li>
<li>Have at least macOS Monterey 12.3</li>

<p>The <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#subscriptions">Quarto Documenation</a> covers how to implement website subscriptions at a surface level. This guide goes into the details on how one could do so, with three different options. <strong>That said</strong>, this guide can also be helpful for sites that do not use Quarto.</p>
<p>The three ways this guide will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Readymade Services</strong></p>
<p>These are services that handle and automate everything for you. MailChimp is mentioned in the Quarto Docs as one option, but is not covered in this guide as it appears they are depracting the RSS email feed function which is necessary. Instead, we have found MailerLite to be a suitable alternative that is easy to setup and use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online Forms</strong></p>
<p>Though more manual, it’s good for just getting started or if you do not have an alternative address — many services like MailerLite require you to include a physical address in your emails. This options will dive into embedding forms, and gathering emails from there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTML/JS</strong></p>
<p>For when you want to handle the frontend and the backend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Switch between the tabs below to view the steps for each option.</p>
<div class="tabset-margin-container"></div><div class="panel-tabset">
<ul class="nav nav-tabs"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link active" id="tabset-1-1-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-1" aria-controls="tabset-1-1" aria-selected="true">Services</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" id="tabset-1-2-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-2" aria-controls="tabset-1-2" aria-selected="false">Online Forms</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" id="tabset-1-3-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-3" aria-controls="tabset-1-3" aria-selected="false">HTML &amp; JS</a></li></ul>
<div class="tab-content">
<div id="tabset-1-1" class="tab-pane active" aria-labelledby="tabset-1-1-tab">
<p>The first thing we need to do is create a MailerLite Campaign. That is what will actually send the email.</p>
<section id="quarto-setup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quarto-setup">Quarto Setup</h3>
<p>Make sure RSS feeds are enabled on your blog. Instructions for how to do this are in <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#rss-feed">the Quarto Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have an account and are logged in, <a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/campaigns/create">create an RSS Campaign</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/mailerlite/MailerLite2_NewCampaign.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As you complete the Campaign creation process there are a few key options to look out for.</p>
<p>As you progress through the signup form you will need to fill in some information and, including the URL of your RSS feed. It should be a URL that ends with <code>.xml</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/mailerlite/MailerLite3_RssFeedUrl.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I recommend setting the email to only be sent when you have new blog posts. This ensures that an email is only sent if you’ve published a new post. Otherwise, an email is sent on a regular interval with the latest posts regardless of whether there is new content.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/mailerlite/MailerLite4_NewPostsOnly.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>On the content page, choose start from scratch (free tier) or select a template (paid) and design your email that will go out.</p>

<p>When you create an RSS campaign there are templates that can be used in the content tab for designing this email. These are paid features that you get for free for the first 30 days. Only use the templates if you intend to pay as they are not included in the free plan.</p>

</div>
<p>Select All Active Subscribers to send to.</p>

<p>You can create individual subscriber groups to have different campaigns go to different groups to give subscribers more options. <a href="https://isaac-flath.tech/blog.html">Example here</a>.</p>

<section id="create-subscribe.html" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-subscribe.html">Create subscribe.html</h3>
<p>Now that the campaign is set up and will go out to all subscribers, we need to create the widget that allows users to subscribe to the blog. In other words we need a way for users to sign up! In Quarto, this is defined in the <code>subscribe.html</code> file. First, we need to use MailerLite to create the contents.</p>
<p>In MailerLite this is called an <code>embedded form</code>. We can use their GUI to <a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/create?type=embedded">Create an embedded form</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/mailerlite/MailerLite9_NewForm.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Once we start the form we can use the GUI form editor to design what we want the form to look like.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/mailerlite/MailerLite11_FormDesign.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I recommend leaving it with the default design for now, you can always come back and re-style it later if you don’t like how it looks on your blog. But it’s much easier to get something working then improve upon it once it’s working than to try to make something perfect the first time through!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you created the form it will take you to that forms <code>Overview</code> page. Scroll down to look for the <code>Embed form into your website</code> section. In that section select <code>HTML Code</code> and copy the code provided.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/mailerlite/MailerLite12_FormHtml.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Paste this code into a <code>subscribe.html</code> file at the top level of your blog’s directory.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modify-_quarto.yml">Modify _quarto.yml</h3>
<p>Add the <code>subscribe.html</code> file to your <code>_quarto.yml</code> file by adding it to the <code>margin-header</code> attribute. This option will look like this in your <code>_quarto.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>That is all it takes to get subscriptions working on your blog with MailerLite! Everything you just set up is editable so if you don’t like how the email or the subscription widget looks, you can go in and edit your templates.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don’t have an alternative address. Or perhaps you just want something simple to get started with. There’s still a way to implement blog subscriptions! It requires more manual effort, but gets the job done: embedding online forms (e.g., Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, etc.).</p>
<p>It involves embedding a form in your website, collecting responses from it, creating a mailing list from those responses, and then composing and sending an email with the list.</p>
<p>The example in the steps below use Google Forms, though it would be very similar to Microsoft Forms. The steps below should also generally apply to any other online forms service.</p>
<section id="step-1-create-the-form." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-create-the-form.">Step 1: Create the form.</h3>
<p>Using your online form provider of choice, create your form! A simple form would include a text box for inputting an email, with a simple check to see if the entered email is valid.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/7_blog_subscriptions/manual/1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>On Google Forms, you have an option to implement email checking with the following option.</p>

<p>You can take these email addresses and create a mailing list in the email service of your choice.</p>
<p>You can also download a CSV file containing the responses.</p>

<p>You could combine the subscribe and unsubscribe forms into a single form so it would be easier to manage. The form would initially ask if a user would like to subscribe or unsubscribe. Based on their input, the form would take them to the appropriate section.</p>
<p>Further expanding on this, if your site has multiple feeds, the form could also ask which feed the user would like to subscribe to or unsubscribe from.</p>

<p>Perhaps you know some HTML and JS, or even only JS, and don’t have an alternative address. Instead of creating the frontend with HTML, try using the <a href="https://github.com/jlgraves-ubc/forms">Quarto HTML Forms</a> extension by <a href="https://github.com/jlgraves-ubc">Jonathan Graves</a>.</p>
<p>This extension allows you to implement HTML forms through <a href="">Quarto Shortcodes</a> and YAML Options. However, you still will need to handle the backend with JavaScript and perhaps a few other technologies. If you’re interested in implementing it this way, you probably already know how to. If not, there are plenty of great guides online!.</p>

<p>Very simple, eh? Of course, it’s a very high level abstraction, but this high level view will make this seemingly complex topic very simple.</p>
<p>First, what’s the main thing modern AI methods try to do? They try to make predictions about certain things.</p>
<p>So a <strong>function</strong> of sorts is needed to achieve this. A function that can make these predictions. Think of a function as a machine. You put something into the machine and then, with whatever was input, the machine then produces an output.</p>
<p>The machine that we will be working with has two input slots: one slot is for <strong>training</strong> and the other slot is for predictions.</p>
<p>To create a function that produces predictions, we need to tell the function what sort of predictions it needs to make.</p>
<p>To do that, we can pour some data into the <strong>training</strong> slot. This data will tell the function what sort of predictions to output. This process is known as <strong>fitting</strong> the function to the data.</p>
<p>To fit the function onto data, you <strong>train</strong> the function.</p>
<section id="simple-case-quadratic-function" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simple-case-quadratic-function">Simple Case: Quadratic Function</h2>
<p><em>Gasp!</em> A quadratic?? What’s this nonsense!</p>
<p>A quadratic is a very simple equation. When shown on a graph, it looks like this.</p>

</div>
<p>We’ll be using this equation to demonstrate a very simple example.</p>
<p>The basic workflow for fitting a function to data is below.</p>
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-2">

<p>It can seem like a lot at first glance; quite a few new terms too.</p>
<p>We’ll break this down by going over the very simple example.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have the following data points that describe, say, the speed of an object with respect to time. We want to predict what the speed of an object would be outside these data points.</p>
<p>The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is the object’s speed.</p>
<div id="f959959d-cd81-4531-ae30-04bbcbfcd1ce" class="cell" data-tags="[]" data-execution_count="7">

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can see that the data looks like the quadratic function shown above! Therefore, we could use the quadratic to predict what the speed of the object would be after 2.0 s and before -2.0 s.</p>
<p>A quadratic equation includes three numbers which we will call <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">. These three numbers affect or control how our quadratic function will end up looking. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> are our <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> all equal <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> to begin with.</p>

<p>Eyeballing this is difficult. A certain set of parameters we use may be good by looking at the resulting graph, but in reality, it may not be.</p>
<p>What we need is something that can tell us how good our function is; something that tells us whether the changes we are making are actually good or not. To do this, we can calculate a number called the <strong>loss</strong>. The smaller the loss, the better the function is.</p>
<p>There are many different ways loss can be calculated. The way we will be doing it is known as <strong>mean absolute error (MAE)</strong>. In simple terms, it tells us how far off each prediction is from the actual value. For example, if we have a MAE of 1, this means that, on average, each prediction we make is 1 unit off from the real value.</p>
<p>In our case, a MAE of 1 would mean that each prediction is on average 1 m/s off from the real value.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat what we did above, but this time, we’ll also see what the MAE is.</p>

<p>Again, this means that on average, each prediction we will make is 2.61 m/s off from the real value.</p>

<p>Hmm, things got worse.</p>
<p>Doing this process by hand is very tedious. How do we know if the new set of parameters we are using would improve the function? There needs to be a way to automate this so we don’t have to sit down and do this by hand.</p>
<p>What we can do is update the parameters based on the loss. This would in turn create new parameters that would decrease the loss.</p>

<p>Let’s give <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> an arbitrary set of parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.1">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1.1">.</p>
<p>Now let’s create a quadratic with this set of parameters and calculate its mean absolute error.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The MAE is 2.42.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now comes the next step: how do we update the parameters based on this loss we have calculated?</p>
<p>To do this, we calculate a new set of quantities known as the gradients. Each parameter has its own gradient.</p>
<p>Let’s say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> has the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> has a gradient of value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.5">, this would mean that if we increase <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, the loss would increase by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.5">. Therefore, if we <em>decrease</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, this would mean the loss would decrease by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.5">, which is what we want!</p>
<p>Read over this once more and it’ll make sense!</p>
<p>Let’s quickly go over the inverse: if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> has a gradient of value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-0.5">, increasing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> would decrease the loss by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.5"> — again, this is what we want! Similarly, decreasing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> would increase the loss by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.5">.</p>
<p>The gradients are calculated from the loss. Then the gradients, the current parameters, and along with another value, the parameters are updated to new values. The “another value” is known as the <strong>learning rate</strong>. The learning rate controls how much the gradients update the parameters.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s break this down. The gradient for the first parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-1.35">. This tells us that if we increase the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, our loss will decrease by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-1.35">. Similary, if we increase the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, this will result in the loss being decreased by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-0.03">. The same logic holds for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">.</p>
<p>Let’s now update the parameters. Remember, the current set of parameters, their gradients, and the learning rate all update the current set of parameters to new values.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-cool-case-relus">The Cool Case: ReLUs</h2>
<p>The quadratic example above is a nice, simple way to get a grasp of things. However, you may be wondering, “What if the data doesn’t follow a quadratic shape? What do we do then?”</p>
<p>And that’s a good question! What if our data doesn’t follow any sort of mathematical shape? What if we don’t even know the shape the data will follow? How do we know what function to use in that case?</p>
<p>There is a solution to that! There is an easy way to create a function that bends and twists itself to fit the data; an “unbound” function of sorts, as I like to call it.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by using another equation known as the <strong>ReLU</strong>. Another fancy word that can make you sound like a professional, while also being really simple. ReLU is short for <strong>Rectified Linear Unit</strong>.</p>
<p>The ReLU takes any value that is less than 0, and converts to 0.</p>
<p>Let’s see this.</p>
<p>Take the following line. It has both positive and negative values on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>When we use a ReLU, all negative values are converted to zero.</p>

<p>See how easy this stuff all is? All those fancy terms makes this feel complex when in reality, it’s all really simple.</p>
<p>Why not now go and venture off to learn more and implement your own models!</p>
<p>Below are two free courses I can recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.elementsofai.com">Elements of AI</a></p>
<p>A great primer into AI. The course goes over the history, the implementations, and the implications of this field, all without needing the knowledge of programming or complex mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://course.fast.ai">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a></p>
<p>This course is different from other AI courses you’ll find. How? Because instead of starting off with the nitty gritty basics, you begin by actually implementing your own simple image classifier (a model that can tell what thing is in an image). You’ll be surprised at how simple it is to implement models with minimal code, and how little you need to know to get started (hint: you only really need high-school maths).</p></li>

<p>The model that will be created in this notebook can detect whether an area shown in an image is flooded or not. The idea for creating this model has been spurred from the recent floodings in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Such models can prove useful in flood relief, helping to detect which areas need immediate focus.</p>
<p>The dataset used to train this model is <strong>Louisiana flood 2016</strong>, uploaded by Kaggle user <strong>Rahul T P</strong>, which you can view <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahultp97/louisiana-flood-2016">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the points of this notebook is to showcase how simple it is to create powerful models. That said, this notebook is <strong>not</strong> a tutorial or guide.</p>

<p>The data in the dataset needs to be organized into <em>train</em> and <em>valid</em> folders. Each will contain the same subfolders, <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>, which will be used to label the data. A label of <code>0</code> indicates the area shown in the image is not flooded, while a label of <code>1</code> indicates the area shown in the image is flooded.</p>
<p>The images in the dataset itself has been organized as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no underscore is in the file name, the image shows the area before or after the flood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an underscore is in the file name, the image shows the area during the flood:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a zero follows the underscore, the area was not flooded.</li>
<li>If a one follows the underscore, the area was flooded.</li>
</ul>

<section id="takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>This model was trained on only 270 images and minimal code. Accessbility and abstraction to the field of machine learning has come a long, long way. Given the right data and the right pretrained model, a powerful model can be produced in less than an hour, if not half.</p>
<p>This is important: in disasters such as floods, the time taken to produce the logistics required for relief can be drastically reduced. It is also important because the barrier of entry to this field is dramatically lowered; more people can create powerful models, in turn producing better solutions.</p>
<p>However, there could be some improvements and additions made to the model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Include a third class to the model. Images that are not flooded, but show signs of having been flooded would be assigned this class. The dataset used for this model includes such images.</p></li>
<li><p>Train the model on images that include a variety of geographic locations and dwellings. The current dataset only contains images taken in a lush, green area with plenty of trees; infrastructure looks a certain way; the color of the floodwater is also dependent on the surroundings. All this makes the model good a prediciting whether an image is flooded for images with certain features.</p></li>
</ul>

  <title>Data Quality is Important | Car Classifier</title>
  <dc:creator>Salman Naqvi</dc:creator>
  <link>https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/posts/4_data_quality_is_important.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This article was updated on <strong>Thursday, 10 November 2022</strong>.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/4_data_quality_is_important/thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A parking lot filled with cars."></p>
<p>I recently created a car classifier that classified cars into their respective brands.</p>
<p>Despite having almost 5000 images in my training set, I ended up trying out over a hundred layers in my model, and twenty epochs. Even then, I had an error rate of 17.4%.</p>
<p>The culprit? My dataset.</p>
<p>I scraped 5000 images of cars (500 for each company) from DuckDuckGo. Naturally, as expected, the data quality is not so good.</p>
<p>Why? Below are some potential reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noncar images present in dataset</li>
<li>Cars of incorrect company present in dataset</li>
<li>F1 cars present in dataset</li>
<li>A large variety of cars from different time periods present in dataset</li>
<li>Different companys’ cars look similar</li>
<li>Modded cars present in dataset</li>
<li>Concept cars present in dataset</li>
<li>Multiple cars present in a single image</li>
<li>Certain angles of cars appear more than others</li>
<li>Cars appear in certain backgrounds more than others</li>
<li>The search term <code>{car_brand} car</code> could be skewing results</li>
</ul>
<p>I could have absolutely achieved better results with fewer layers and fewer epochs if I trained the model on better quality data — or manually combed through the 5000 images 💀. However, I did use fastai’s GUI for data cleaning. This GUI sorts images by their loss which helps to determine if certain images should be relabeled or deleted.</p>
<p>Below is the confusion matrix for this model.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/4_data_quality_is_important/confusion_matrix.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:65.0%" alt="A confusion matrix of the model."></p>
<p>It can be seen that this model “confuses” between quite a few different brands: Ford and Chevrolet, Chevrolet and Ford, Jaguar and Aston Martin, Renault and Ford.</p>
<p>But <strong>why</strong> is data quality important? Because without good data, the model will not be able to “see” things the way they actually are, and in turn end up making worse predictions and not generalize to other data.</p>
<p>Let’s say you did not know how, say, a toaster looked like. So I taught you by showing you pictures of a kettle. Then to test you, I showed you a set of pictures depicting various kitchen appliances and told you to find the toaster. You would not be able to.</p>

<p>Extending upon this example, say I showed you toasters only from the last two years and from two brands only. You would not be able to identify toasters older than two years, and toasters from other brands to much success.</p>
<p>Obviously, humans are smarter and can infer. AI methods can only infer to a certain degree, mainly based on what is in their dataset. This talk does start to become more philosophical.</p>
<p>The point of this post is to emphasize the importance of data quality and different aspects to consider as to why data quality may not be good. You can have the best architecture in the world, but it is useless if you do not have good data.</p>

  <title>A No Nonsense Guide to Reading a Confusion Matrix</title>
  <dc:creator>Salman Naqvi</dc:creator>

<p>Confusion matrices help model designers view what mistakes a model has made.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll be telling you how to easily read such matrices.</p>
<p>Jump to Section&nbsp;2 for an ultra concise rundown.</p>
<p>Ready? Here we go.</p>
<section id="case-1-introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-1-introduction">Case 1: Introduction</h2>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/3_the_confusion_matrix/confusion_matrix_1.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<p>Ignore the “Actual” and “Predicted” labels for now.</p>
<p>Let’s compare grizzly bears to black bears.</p>
<p>All comparisons begin at the bottom, with the columns.</p>
<p>First, highlight the grizzly bear column.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/3_the_confusion_matrix/confusion_matrix_1_1.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<p>Next, highlight the black bear row.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/3_the_confusion_matrix/confusion_matrix_1_2.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<p>Now find the common entry in the highlighted column and row.</p>
<p><img src="https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/images/3_the_confusion_matrix/confusion_matrix_1_3.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<p>This common entry is our required information.</p>
<p>All entries in the diagonal going from the top left to the bottom right (blue) are correct classifications. All other entries are incorrect classifications.</p>
<p>Our common entry does not lie in the main diagonal. Therefore, we are looking at incorrect classifications.</p>
<p>We have compared grizzly bears to black bears. Therefore, from this deduction, <strong>three grizzly bears have been incorrectly classified as black bears</strong>.</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at creating an AI model: an image classifier. This classifier can tell whether a grizzly bear, black bear, or teddy bear is in an image.</p>
<p>You can visit the classifier <a href="https://forbo7.github.io/web_apps/apps/bear_detector.html">here</a> to test it out for yourself!</p>

<p>The <code>blocks</code> parameter allows us to specify the independent and dependent variables.</p>
<p>The <code>get_items</code> parameter tells fastai how to obtain our data. We use the <code>get_image_files</code> function to obtain our images.</p>
<p>The <code>splitter</code> parameter allows us to tell fastai how to split our data into training and validation sets. Since our data is one big set, we use the <code>RandomSplitter</code> class and tell it to use 20% of our data as the validation set. We specify a seed so the same split occurs each time.</p>
<p>The <code>get_y</code> parameter obtains our labels. The <code>parent_label</code> function simply gets the name of the folder a file is in. Since we have organized our bear images into different folders, this will nicely handle our target labels.</p>
<p>The <code>item_tfms</code> parameter allows us to specify a transform to apply to our data. Since we want all our images to be of the same size, we use the <code>Resize()</code> class.</p>
<p>We now have a DataBlock object from which can load the data.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-augmentation">Data Augmentation</h2>
<p>Data augmentation refers to creating random variations to our input data. This produces new data points based on the existing data points. This allows each data point to look different, without changing their meaning.</p>
<p>Typical examples of image augmentation include rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changing, and contrast changing.</p>
<section id="cropping" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cropping">Cropping</h3>
<p>The validation set images shown above are cropped. We achieved this by specifying the <code>Resize</code> argument when defining the <code>DataBlock</code>. <code>Resize</code> crops images to the size specified.</p>
<p>Cropping results in detail being lost.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can squish or stretch images, or pad them to a desired size.</p>

<section id="squishingstretching" class="level3">

<p>The intuitive approach to data cleaning is to do it before training the model. However, a trained model can help us clean the data. For example, we can see some mislabaled bears in the above cases.</p>
<p>fastai includes a GUI for data cleaning. This GUI allows you to choose a category/label and its associated training and validation sets. It then shows you images in order of highest-loss first, from which you can select images for removal or relabeling.</p>

<p>A model consists of two parts: the architecture and the parameters.</p>

<p>This method also saves the definition of our <code>DataLoaders</code>. This is done so that we do not have to redefine how to transform our data when the model is used in production.</p>
<p>fastai uses our validation set <code>DataLoader</code> by default, so the data augmentation will not be applied, which is generally what is wanted.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-cnns-work-so-well">Why CNNs work so well</h2>
<p>The ResNet18 architecture is a sort of CNN. Below is my understanding as to why CNNs work so well.</p>
<p>A neural network is comprised of many layers. Each layer is comprised of many neurons. In a CNN, each neuron in the same layer is given the exact same weights, while being given different input data. This allows all neurons in a layer to fire upon detecting the same pattern.</p>
<p>Because of this, CNNs can become really good at detecting objects in various patterns, orientations, shapes, positions, and so on.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well then, that wraps up my first deep learning model! I have to say, it is much easier than I thought it would be to implement a model. You do not need to go into the nitty gritty details of artificial intelligence. A high level understanding can suffice in the beginning. It is like playing a sport: you do not need to understand the physics to be able to play it.</p>
