# The website of ForBo7 // Salman Naqvi!

It's a 3-in-1 site: it's personal, it has my blog, and it shows my works!

## Features

### Landing Page

The landing page features a dynamic dual-listing in conjunction with the about me template. This is done through the use of CSS grids and Quarto divs.

### ForBlog

My blog where I post what I'm learning and what's on my mind!

### App Playground

A place where I can display various apps and gizmos I make.

### More coming soon

I plan to continue to update my site with more features, especially through the use of Quarto extensions.

## Quarto

This website was created with the open-source [Quarto](https://quarto.org) framework — a framework that allows you to create almost any sort of document 
possible from a single markdown file! From websites to presentations to books!

## Reference

This website uses many of Quarto features, and as such, can be used as a reference guide for how to implement such features yourself. See a feature on my 
site you want to implement yourself? Check the URL of the page, and look up the same page at the same path in this repository.
