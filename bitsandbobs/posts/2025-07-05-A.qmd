A shell hook is a piece of shell script that is called before or after the shell displays the prompt.

I want to use conda and uv together. Conda's great as swithcing environments on the fly, and uv is great for speed. However, while `uv pip install` makes use of the current conda environment, `uv sync` and `uv add` don't

I came across [this](https://github.com/warner-benjamin/uv-conda) rc script that sets the environment variable uv uses to allow it to work with conda.

```bash
# Function to update UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT when Conda environment changes
conda_auto_env() {
    if [[ -n "$CONDA_PREFIX" ]]; then
        export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT="$CONDA_PREFIX"
    else
        unset UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT
    fi
}

# Run the function initially to set the variable immediately
conda_auto_env

# Hook into shell prompts
if [[ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]]; then
    # Ensure add-zsh-hook is available
    autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook
    # Avoid duplicate hooks
    if ! [[ -v _conda_update_hook_added ]]; then
        add-zsh-hook precmd conda_auto_env
        _conda_update_hook_added=1
    fi
elif [[ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]]; then
    # Ensure PROMPT_COMMAND is updated only once
    if [[ -z "$PROMPT_COMMAND" ]]; then
        PROMPT_COMMAND="conda_auto_env"
    elif [[ "$PROMPT_COMMAND" != *"conda_auto_env"* ]]; then
        PROMPT_COMMAND="conda_auto_env; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
    fi
fi
```

Programming the shell is new to me, and I wanted to understand what exactly this script was doing. So after chatting with a LLM, I discovered the world of shell hooks.

The script begins by first settings the `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` to be the path that `$CONDA_PREFIX` uses.

```bash
conda_auto_env() {
    if [[ -n "$CONDA_PREFIX" ]]; then
        export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT="$CONDA_PREFIX"
    else
        unset UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT
    fi
}
```

Then, a `precmd` shell hook is created. So the moment before a new prompt appears in the shell, `conda_auto_env` is run to set the uv environment to be the same as the conda environment. 

```bash
# Ensure add-zsh-hook is available
autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook
# Avoid duplicate hooks
if ! [[ -v _conda_update_hook_added ]]; then
    add-zsh-hook precmd conda_auto_env
    _conda_update_hook_added=1
fi
```
