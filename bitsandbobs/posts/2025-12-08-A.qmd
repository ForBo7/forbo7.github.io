- Modulo division can be a way to loop through a list of numbers without needing a `for` loop. For examples, using `%100` to rotate through a list of numbers from 0-99.
- Integer division can be used to check the number of times a list of numbers loops through a certain number, without needing a `for` loop. For example, using `//100` to count the number of times 0 has been looped through in a list of numbers from 0-99.
- Use `itertools.accumulate` to perfom accumulation on a list of numbers
- Dictionaries, such as `{'L':-1, 'R':1}`, can be used to replace `if/elif` blocks
