Divisor larger than dividend:

- `5%2=1`
- `158%100=58`

Divisor smaller than dividend:

- `2%5=2`
- `100%158=100`

Negative divisor (in Python, the remainder must always be positive):

- `-18%100=82`
- `-188%100=100`

Handy template expression to use: `divisor = ? * dividend + remainder`, where `?` is the number of times the dividend fits into the divisor.
- `158%100`: `158 = ? * 100 + remainder`
- `-18%100`: `-18 = ? * 100 + remainder`
  - In Python, the remainder must always be positive. Thus, `?` in this case is `-1`.
